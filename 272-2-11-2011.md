# Show 272: Valentine's Day Special: Unrequited Love
{genre: Rock 'n' roll} is filled with songs about {tag: Unrequited Love}. This week {host: Jim}, {host: Greg} and listeners from around the country pick their favorites for {tag: Valentine's Day}.

## 00:01:49 News: 2.11.2011
Sad news for a number of rock fans this week. Both {artist: The White Stripes} and {artist: LCD Soundsystem} have announced they are closing up shop. {name: James Murphy} of LCD Soundsystem suggested he'd be calling it quits (at least under that name) when he was on Sound Opinions last year. But the White Stripes announcement has come as a surprise. {host: Greg} is disappointed since {name: Jack White}'s other side projects as a member of {artist: The Dead Weather} and {artist: The Raconteurs} and {tag: producer} of albums by {artist: Wanda Jackson} haven't provided him the vehicle he deserves. But, as {host: Jim} notes, the adage is true: nothing gives an artist a greater boost than dying or breaking up. Albums by The White Stripes have seen a massive sales surge.

{artist: U2}'s {name: Bono} and {name: the Edge} have joined forces with veteran theater and film director {tag: Julie Taymor} to bring {tag: Spider-Man} to the {place: Broadway} stage. The early reviews are in, and they ain't pretty. From {tag: The New York Times} ("sheer ineptitude") to the {tag: Los Angeles Times} ("an artistic form of megalomania") to the {tag: Chicago Tribune} ("incoherent"), the critical {tag: pans} are far harsher than anything U2 has received on any album. And it wasn't for lack of funds. The $65 million musical production is charging fans up to $300 just for previews. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wonder if {tag: *Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark*} will fare any better than {tag: Capeman}.
