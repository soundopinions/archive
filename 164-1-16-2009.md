# Show 164: Presidential Rock & Opinions on Franz Ferdinand
As the nation awaits its new president, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} host their own inaugural celebration featuring the best in "Presidential Rock."

## 00:04:52 News: 01.16.09
The nail has just gone in the record store coffin. The {place: Times Square} {label: Virgin} Megastore, which is the highest volume music store in America, is closing this spring. $55 million in annual revenue was not enough to keep the doors to this landmark retail outfit open. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree that the Virgin store on {place: Broadway} was an institution for any music fan who visited {place: New York City}, and hope that people continue to support what record stores are still out there.

Rocker, poet, fashion designer, activist...now {name: Bono} can add columnist to that ever-growing list. The {artist: U2} frontman just published his first official column for {tag: The New York Times}. It was written about music's other great ego: {artist: Frank Sinatra}. Jim doesn't see why anyone would be interested in the writings of Bono, except for the fact that he is a celebrity. But Greg is a little more hopeful. He admits that Bono is not a great scribe, but thinks that if the singer sticks to what he knows– music– we may be in for some interesting stories.

## 00:10:01 Special: Presidential Rock
On January 20th, thousands will celebrate the Inauguration of {tag: President}-Elect {name: Barack Obama}. But before that {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wanted to host their own celebration by playing the best songs ever written about the office of Commander-in-Chief. 

Here's a collection of songs to kick off this new administration:

### Jim
- {artist: Neil Young}, "{track: Campaigner}"
- {artist: The Ramones}, "{track: Bonzo Goes to Bitburg}"
- {artist: They Might Be Giants}, "{track: James K. Polk}"
- {artist: Lou Reed}, "{track: The Day John Kennedy Died}"

### Greg
- {artist: JB Lenore}, "{track: Eisenhower Blues}"
- {artist: XTC}, "{track: Here Comes President Kill Again}"
- {artist: Wyclef Jean}, "{track: President}"
- {artist: George Clinton}, "{track: Paint the White House Black}"

## 00:47:02 Review: Franz Ferdinand
![Tonight: Franz Ferdinand](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/9c/e0/c4/9ce0c45d-0d73-4a67-a4e1-f8ef99c5c10b/source/600x600bb.jpg "6596751/353898208")
Scottish {genre: indie} rockers {artist: Franz Ferdinand} have a new album out called {album: Tonight: Franz Ferdinand}. It's the third release for the {genre: New-New Wave} band, and after a terrific debut, and a so-so follow-up, Jim and Greg were eager to see what the quartet had to offer. Greg hears a reconfiguration of their original sound. The {genre: dance} element is more up front, making the rhythm section the most important one. Greg keeps waiting for lead singer {name: Alex Kapranos} to step up to the {name: Bryan Ferry} level, and until he does {host: Greg} gives {album: Tonight: Franz Ferdinand} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} doesn't think it's fair to compare any mere mortal to Bryan Ferry and thinks Kapranos does a terrific job. He calls the group's routine "winning" and gives this album a {tag: Buy It}.
