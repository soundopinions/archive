Second only to {tag: file sharing}, {tag: Apple} has been the biggest force driving digital music distribution. It's the culprit killing {tag: CDs}, but now they are trying to make nice with the record labels. First they raised prices, and now they have set a plan to expand album downloads. {tag: iTunes} is mostly all about the singles, but they are helping labels entice people to download multi-song packages with lots of extrasâ€“ liner notes, pictures, video, etc. {host: Greg }is not sure we can blame digital music entirely for the death of the album. He also wonders if quality has something to do with it.

{host: Jim }and Greg have been reporting on the proposed merger between {tag: Ticketmaster }and {tag: Live Nation} for months, and now our lawmakers are urging for an accelerated investigation. {place: Wisconsin} Senator {name: Herb Kohl}, chair of the Judiciary Committee's {tag: antitrust } subcommittee, is calling for closer scrutiny of the deal and questions how it will benefit consumers. Fifty members of the U.S. {tag: House of Representatives} have also signed a letter to the {tag: Justice Department} expressing concern about the deal. 

{artist: Jackson Browne} and {name: John McCain} make for strange bedfellows. But that didn't stop the {tag: Republican} candidate from using the famous lefty's song "{track: Running on Empty}" in a campaign web video. Browne subsequently sued, and now a settlement has been reached. There are no details on how much money was exchanged, but McCain apologized and stressed his respect for intellectual property.

## 00:49:59 Review: The Fiery Furnaces
![I'm Going Away (Bonus Track Version)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/77/eb/e7/77ebe70b-8edc-83a5-840e-fdfb81e0ecb9/source/600x600bb.jpg "5543027/323166409")

In just six years the brother-sister duo {artist: The Fiery Furnaces} have released eight albums. But, as {host: Jim} points out, being prolific doesn't make you infallible. He admires lead singer {name: Eleanor Friedberger}'s {artist: Lou Reed} singing style, but otherwise was put off by their newest album {album: I'm Going Away}. Its hyper-literary and overly orchestrated songs gave Jim a headache, and therefore prompted a {tag: Trash It} rating. {host: Greg} couldn't disagree more. He calls {album: I'm Going Away} one of the great {genre: pop} albums of the summer. He admits that much of their previous work was a little obtuse, but he thinks The Fiery Furnaces have channeled their energy into a less frantic, more melodic record. Greg calls it {genre: art rock} on a budget and gives it a {tag: Buy It}.
