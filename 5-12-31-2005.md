{host: Greg} Kot's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} selection for this week is "{track: A Woman Needs to be Loved}" by {artist: Tyrone Davis}. Greg notes that three great {genre: soul} singers died in {era: 2005}; {artist: Eugene Record}, {artist: Luther Vandross}, and {artist: Tyrone Davis}, with Tyrone being the most overlooked and versatile of the three. Greg points out that you can hear the resentment and pain in Tyrone's voice, over the knowledge that he was wrong. This pain makes this track the standout in his discography.
