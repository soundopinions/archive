# Show 508: Rock Doctors Return
![rock doctors](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/rockdoctors_email.jpg)

Jim and Greg put on their white coats once again as the Rock Doctors attend to a patient in need of some musical treatment. This time they attempt to revive a woman bored by rock's recent formulaic trends.

## 00:02:08 News: 08.21.15

The biopic film {tag: *Straight Outta Compton*} debuted this past weekend to a monster box office earning over $56 million. The movie tells the story of the group {artist: N.W.A.} and how they created the blue print for {genre: west coast }and {genre: gangster rap} in the {era: '80s} and early {era: '90s}. {host: Jim} recently saw the film and thought more about the biopic genre in general. He thought that this was a VH1-type film that largely glossed over many of the important truths of the band's history, including {artist: Dr. Dre}'s misogyny in both his lyrics and his actions. {host: Greg} agrees that the story of {tag: Dee Barnes}, a female journalist covering N.W.A who was physically assaulted by Dre, was excluded from the film. Jim ultimately thinks the biopic doesn't work as journalism or biography, but instead acts as a missed opportunity to tell the whole truth of the story.

Two celebrated {era: '70s} producers passed away this week: {name: Bob Johnston}, longtime {artist: Bob Dylan} producer, and {name: Billy Sherrill}, creator of the {genre: countrypolitan} genre and producer of {artist: George Jones} and {artist: Tammy Wynette}. As an in-house producer for {tag: Columbia Records}, Johnston produced some of Dylan's most notable albums, including {album: *Blonde on Blonde*} and {album: *Nashville Skyline*}. Johnston also served as the producer for {artist: Johnny Cash}'s {album: *At Folsom Prison*}, which only came about after Johnston's persistent efforts. With a similar determination, Sherrill ignited the careers of country artists like Jones and Wynette with hit songs "{track: He Stopped Loving Her Today}" and "{track: Stand By Your Man.}" However, Greg chooses to honor Sherrill by playing {artist: The Staple Singers}' "{track: Why Am I Treated So Bad}," a track that he produced before entering the country music scene. Sherrill produced songs for early {genre: R&B} artists when no other producer would, earning him tremendous respect.  


## 00:09:00 Interview: Jeffrey Brown
 "{track: Happy Birthday}" is a song nearly everyone knows, so it seems like it should belong in the public domain. However, for several years now there has been a fight over whether the song is for the public or is the copyright of {label: Warner/Chappell Music}. {name: Jeffrey Brown}, a prominent trademark lawyer, joined us this week to discuss the case which appears to be wrapping up soon. Jeffrey believes that Warner will actually lose their claim to the copyright, and may have to pay back millions in licensing fees because the song should never have been copyrighted to begin with! Sound Opinions will continue to follow this case and we wish you all a Happy Birthday in the least costly way we can. 


## 00:21:17 Rock Doctors: Jessica 
Once again, it's time for the **{tag: Rock Doctors}** to put on their white coats and stethoscopes. During this appointment, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} attempt to treat a fast spreading musical virus. Their patient is {name: Jessica} from {place: Montreal}. Jessica comes to the Rock Doctors Clinic with a bad case of "musical mailase, lyric lethargy, and beat fatigue." Jessica has become uninterested in the {genre: rock} music of today, which she perceives as redundant and insincere. The doctors' job is to help her reignite her passion for her favorite genre. 

Jessica is well-versed in rock music, and spends a good amount of time listening to independent radio station {tag: WFMU} with her husband, a rock DJ. Jessica loves rock music's focus on instrumentation, and her favorite album of {era: 2014} was {album: *Brand New Day*} by {artist: The Ugly Beats}, a young {genre: garage rock} band out of {place: Texas}. 

Greg's prescription is the album {album: *MCII*} from {place: San Francisco} {tag: multi-instrumentalist} {artist: Mikal Cronin}, while Jim recommends the album {album: *Slow Gum*} from {place: Australian} {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: Fraser A. Gorman}. During their follow-up appointment, Jessica shares that she really enjoyed both records. She appreciates the balance of honest, personal lyrics with dynamic instrumentation, and found that both artists avoided the musical cliches that once plagued her. Greg and Jim decide that Jessica's knowledge of rock music would make her quite the rock critic. 

Do you need to see the {tag: Rock Doctors}? Or know someone who does? Fill out [new patient form](http://www.soundopinions.org/rockdocsform.pdf) and send to interact@soundopinions.org.

## 00:43:16 Review: Dr. Dre
![Compton](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Music5/v4/e9/f1/46/e9f14631-6a8c-01bf-d1b5-22a2a99c1b8b/UMG_cvrart_00602547530684_01_RGB72_1500x1500_15UMGIM41458.600x600-75.jpg "35315/1027466360")
{artist: Dr. Dre}'s {album: *Compton*} is the {genre: hip hop} legend's first album since 1999, released as a companion to {tag: *Straight Outta Compton*}, the new {tag: biopic} of his former group {artist: N.W.A.} Dre has been one of the most influential figures in hip hop, equally due to his own albums, his production work for artists like {artist: Snoop Dogg}, and his history of grooming new talent like {artist: Eminem} and {artist: Kendrick Lamar}. {host: Jim} always thought Dre was overrated as a producer and is disgusted by the misogny in much of *Compton*'s lyrics, which takes away from some of the more interesting political tracks. For Jim, it's a clear {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg}, on the other hand, praises Dre's production work, noting that by collaborating with younger producers {name: King Mez} and {name: Justus} he is reentering the conversation as a relevant figure. But Greg agrees that some of the lyrical content is stomach churning. Still, there are enough brilliant tracks to earn it a {tag: Try It} rating.

## 00:50:21 DIJ: Jim
A listener recently asked {host: Jim} for some musical gift advice for her boyfriend's 30th birthday, leading Jim to dig out a 30-year-old mixtape of his from 1985. One of the artists featured on the tape was {artist: Breaking Circus}, a forgotten {place: Chicago} {genre: post-punk} band formed by {name: Steve Björklund} that fell somewhere in between the pop hooks of {artist: Naked Raygun} and the abrasiveness of {artist: Big Black}. Jim particularly loves the weirdness of "{track: (Knife in the) Marathon}," which tells the strange tale of an athlete from a third world country wrestled to the ground by security for carrying a knife. Jim would never have remembered this song without the mixtape, so he's grateful for the prompt as he nominates it for the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
