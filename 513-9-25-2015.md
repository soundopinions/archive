# Show 513: Alice Cooper
![Alice Cooper](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/alicecooper_web.jpg)

{artist: Alice Cooper} invented {genre: shock-rock} in the {genre: 1970s}, sparking controversy with his ghoulishly theatrical live shows and hard rock hits like "{track: School's Out}" and "{track: I'm Eighteen}." Alice Cooper joins hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot for a career-spanning conversation.


## 00:02:15 News: 09.25.15
This week marks the thirtieth anniversary of the {tag: Parents Music Resource Center}-inspired {tag: Senate} hearings in {era: 1985}. The {tag: PMRC}, co-founded by {name: Tipper Gore} and {name: Susan Baker}, was pushing {tag: Congress} to clamp down on songs with questionable lyrics because it claimed the music was having an adverse effect on America's youth. But there to testify eloquently in defense of free speech was the unlikely trio of {artist: Frank Zappa}, {artist: John Denver}, and {name: Dee Snider} of {artist: Twisted Sister}. The PMRC hearings led to the ubiquitous {tag: Parental Advisory stickers} that many CDs were forced to carry. Some retailers would refuse to stock any CDs that had the labels, which was a major concern in the pre-Internet era when access to music was more restricted. The PMRC even issued a "{tag: Filthy Fifteen}" list of particularly objectionable songs, including tracks by {artist: Prince}, {artist: Mötley Crüe}, and even {artist: Cyndi Lauper}.


{name: Win Butler}, lead singer of {artist: Arcade Fire}, has spoken out against the poorly managed launch of the {tag: Tidal} {tag: streaming} service – despite being one of its celebrity investors. He still defends the concept of offering HD-quality streaming, but blames Tidal's struggles on the major labels insisting on a $20 per month fee, twice the cost of {tag: Spotify}. But {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} wonder if Butler should be concerned with cleaning his own house first. Despite being signed to the respected indie {label: Merge}, Arcade Fire still has deals with major labels for distribution and promotion.


## 00:08:10 Interview: Alice Cooper
This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to {genre: shock-rock} legend {artist: Alice Cooper}. Cooper was born in {place: Detroit} but later moved to {place: Arizona} for high school, where he was a teenage jock in a rock band. His group, {artist: The Spiders}, performed around {place: Phoenix} and {place: LA} for a few years before they changed their name to Alice Cooper (Alice's real name is Vincent Furnier.) Their first couple albums {album: *Pretties For You* }and {album: *Easy Action*} didn't gain much traction but once they teamed up with producer {name: Bob Ezrin}, they found success with the album {album: *Love It to Death*}. A string of popular records followed such as {album: *School's Out*}, {album: *Billion Dollar Babies*} and {album: *Welcome to My Nightmare*} but for a time, critics couldn't see past the group's on-stage antics. Alice is perhaps most famous for his special brand of shock-rock including props like snakes, guillotines and even straight jackets. Now, he put out a 15-CD box set, {album: *The Studio Albums 1969-1983*} and is touring with his new supergroup {artist: The Hollywood Vampires}, which he formed alongside {name: Johnny Depp} and {artist: Aerosmith} guitarist {name: Joe Perry}. Jim and Greg were very excited to speak with Cooper and discuss his on-stage persona, sobriety, music catalogue and relationships with other famous artists.

## 00:49:51 DIJ: Jim

This week, {host: Jim} decided to select a track by the all-girl band {artist: She}. The song {track: "Outta Reach"} was released on {label: Kent Records} as a single in {era: 1970}. Jim was inspired by an article from music critic {tag: Lindsay Zoladz} that originally appeared in *Bitch Magazine*. Her piece billed She as "the greatest girl group you've never heard of." That got Jim thinking about the lack of girl rock bands in music history and how this ensemble in particular was powerful, sonically interesting but unfortunately never hit it big. However, Jim really likes this track, which showcases She in their glory days.
