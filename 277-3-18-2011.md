# Show 277: Copyright Criminals & Opinions on R.E.M.

## 00:01:50 Special: Copyright Criminals
Musicians throughout time, from {artist: Igor Stravinsky} to {artist: MC Hammer} to {artist: Girl Talk}, owe a great debt to {tag: sampling}. The act of quoting, re-contextualizing or "stealing" from other artists has become an {tag: art form} in itself. But the practice of sampling has also caused a lot of {tag: controversy} when it comes to the law and ideas about {tag: intellectual property}. So {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} spend the bulk of today's episode digging into sampling. First they talk to {name: Kembrew McLeod}, a {tag: filmmaker} and professor of {tag: communication studies} at the {place: University of Iowa}. His latest {tag: documentary}, {tag: *Copyright Criminals*}, examines debates about the value and legality of sampling. 

Jim and Greg also play their favorite sample-based songs:

### Jim
- "{track: Loser}" by {artist: Beck}
- "{track: Kick Push}" by {artist: Lupe Fiasco}
- "{track: Groove Is In the Heart}" by {artist: Deee-Lite}

### Greg
- "{track: Power}," by {artist: John Oswald}
- "{track: Welcome to the Terrordome}" by {artist: Public Enemy}
- "{track: Stem}" by {artist: DJ Shadow}

## 00:48:15 Review: R.E.M.
![Collapse Into Now](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/f0/db/a5/f0dba5e5-0e3d-15cf-fcf1-6cbc47855fde/source/600x600bb.jpg "311145/1095594828")
It's hard to believe, but {artist: R.E.M.} has put out its fifteenth album. The formerly {genre: indie} quartet from {place: Athens} is now a major label trio, and many fans have been waiting for a "return to form." Well, they get it with {album: Collapse Into Now}...sort of. As {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explain, the record is full of nods to older R.E.M. material, but nothing as strong. Why not just sit back and listen to the albums from the '{era: 80s} and '{era: 90s}? They add that the {tag: loss} of {tag: drummer} {name: Bill Berry} keeps getting magnified as the years go by. *Collapse Into Now* gets a double {tag: Burn It}.
