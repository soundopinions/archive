## 00:44:11 Review: Priests
![Nothing Feels Natural](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/bf/db/43/bfdb4378-3817-af2a-4ed3-e153bdc6b122/source/600x600bb.jpg "281875750/1192349646")
{place: Washington, DC} quartet {artist: Priests} prove that {genre: punk} is alive and well in the Nation's Capital. The band has been on a healthy clip since 2011 releasing music and touring but {album: Nothing Feels Natural} is the band's debut full-length album release. {host: Greg} says it is an ambitious "critique of nothing less than America" full of sarcastic views on politics and capitalism. Those heavy ideas are bouyed by a "fantastic rhytm section" that keeps Greg "spinning around an imaginary dance floor". {host: Jim} hears a strong {genre: post-punk} influence hailing to the early 1980s but thinks this is an album that can "only be made by someone of the current generation" tackling technology and feelings of isolation. It is an enthusiastic doube {tag: Buy It}!

### In Memoriam: David Axelrod
![David Axelrod](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2017/davidaxelrod.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} pay tribute this week to the great composer, producer, arranger, and songwriter {artist: David Axelrod}, who [died February 5 at age 83](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7678074/david-axelrod-dead-musician-producer). Though never a household name, he pioneered a dense, sophisticated merger of {genre: soul}, {genre: jazz}, {genre: R&B}, and {genre: orchestral} pop that  was embraced decades later by the {genre: hip-hop} world. After early successes producing for {artist: Lou Rawls} and {artist: Cannonball Adderley}, Axelrod sought to expand upon {artist: Brian Wilson} and {name: George Martin}'s use of the studio as an instrument. That became clear on his writing and arrangement of {artist: The Electric Prunes}' {album: Mass in F Minor} â€“ a full liturgical mass, sung in Latin and Greek, with {genre: psychedelic} orchestra. Greg cites Axelrod's 1968 solo debut, {album: Song of Innocence}, as his masterpiece. An orchestral concept album based on {name: William Blake}'s poetry, the record has since been sampled by dozens of hip-hop artists, from {artist: Dr. Dre} to {artist: DJ Shadow} to {artist: Lil Wayne}.
