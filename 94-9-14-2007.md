# Show 94: The Flaming Lips
Oklahoma's Fabulous Freaks are coming to Sound Opinions! Wayne Coyne and Steven Drozd of the Flaming Lips join Jim and Greg for a rare conversation about how the twenty-five year music veterans have stayed so weird for so long.

![The Flaming Lips](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2007/flaminglips.jpg)

## 00:01:45 News: 09.14.07
{genre: Hard rock} gods {artist: Led Zeppelin} announced its surviving members {name: Robert Plant}, {name: Jimmy Page} and {name: John Paul Jones} will perform live for one night only at {place: England}'s 02 arena. The missing {name: John Bonham} drum slot will be filled by his son {name: Jason Bonham}. This event is all for charity. It's in honor of the late {label: Atlantic Records} co-founder {name: Ahmet Ertegün}. All proceeds will go towards the {tag: Ahmet Ertegün Education Fund}. Robert Plant's altruism and high regard for Mr. Ertegün must be quite substantial considering he had [this harsh thing](http://www.vulture.com/2007/09/led_zeppelin_reunion_to_be_terrible.html) to say back in 2002 about the band reuniting. Jim points out that nowadays no band ever stays broken up and predicts that once the band finishes this gig, they'll launch a world tour. Zep heads everywhere are crossing their fingers.

"Amateur" singer-songwriter {artist: Marié Digby} rose to pop success this summer from her "DIY" video of her covering {artist: Rihanna}'s "{track: Umbrella}" on acoustic guitar. The video has been viewed 2.3 million times and launched her into US radio and iTunes success. It turns out her entire "amateur" marketing campaign was orchestrated by the not-so-amateur {label: Hollywood Records}. The Disney owned Hollywood Records signed Digby back in 2005 -- well before she/the machine posted her {tag: YouTube} video. The fact the she was on a major label was kept hidden until only very recently. Greg points out how this shows you how much a sham the major labels have become when Digby herself states she didn't think people would like her if they knew she was on a major label. Greg feels now that the artifice is exposed, her 15 minutes are over.

Pioneering {genre: jazz} keyboardist {artist: Joe Zawinul} died recently at the age of 75. Zawinul was one of the founding members of the {era: 1970s} {genre: jazz fusion} band {artist: The Weather Report}. According to Jim and Greg, the band was the pinnacle of the jazz {genre: fusion} sound, a melding of {genre: rock 'n' roll} and jazz. {name: [Joe] Zawinul} introduced the synthesizer and {genre: electronic} instrumentation to jazz. He helped pioneer the jazz fusion genre with {artist: Miles Davis} on Davis's {album: In a Silent Way} and {album: Bitches Brew}. Jim and Greg also ask listeners not to blame Zawinul and Davis for where the jazz/rock fusion led to. As a tribute to Joe Zawinul, Jim and Greg play The Weather Report's most iconic song, "{track: Birdland}."

## 00:11:36 Interview: The Flaming Lips
This week's guests are two of the members of {place: Oklahoma}'s {artist: [The] Flaming Lips}, co-founder {name: Wayne Coyne} and long-time member, multi instrumentalist and co-songwriter {name: Steve Drozd}. Wayne chimes in that their two other current band members, {name: Michael Ivins} and touring drummer Clifford, couldn't make it to the interview. Ivins was too preoccupied erecting the UFO for that night's live gig in Chicago. Greg points out that Wayne at one time admitted he was part of a band that couldn't play, had a singer that couldn't sing, and heralded from an unknown town. Yet, here they are 25 years later, still going strong. As someone who wrote a book about The Flaming Lips. Jim continues to be astounded by the extensiveness of their career. He feels it parallels the career of {artist: Pink Floyd} who had at least four different incarnations over 30 or 40 years. The Lips' first era was their {era: '80s} {genre: psychedelic} era with it's key album {album: In a Priest Driven Ambulance} from {era: 1990}. On this album, former Lips drummer {name: Jonathan Donahue} replaced {name: Nathan Roberts} and the band collaborated for the first time with producer {name: Dave Fridmann}. Fridmann, who would go on produce many other Lips' albums, brought a higher level of musicality and production to the Lips' sound. {album: In a Priest Driven Ambulance} was also the album that introduced {name: Steve Drozd} to the Flaming Lips (he did not join the band until almost a decade into the band's career). Drozd loved the album's "loud psychedelic rock guitar" with "hokum balladry". Greg also adds that the record contained a non-ironic cover of {artist: Louis Armstrong}'s "{track: It's a Wonderful World}" amidst the cynical and cooler-than-thou {genre: indie rock} community.

Even though the band started in 1983, it wasn't until {era: 1992} that {artist: The Flaming Lips} signed to a major label. The first album for {label: Warner Brothers Records} was {album: Hit to Death in the Future Head}. Wayne and the band saw this as an opportunity to make a record that's worth the "billion dollars" major labels can spend on albums. Greg feels that their new ambition really exceeded the ambition they had with their previous work. He feels it's clearly evident in {era: 1993}'s {album: Transmissions from the Satellite Heart}. To Jim this album marks the moment when Wayne's songwriting started to rise from the background and move towards the caliber of the Lips' sonic density. {album: Transmission from the Satellite Heart}'s, "{track: She Don't Use Jelly}" is such an example. Even though the song became their breakthrough "wiggy, novelty hit." it was a "beautiful {genre: bubble gum} song with a poignant lyric" wrapped inside an amazing musical production. Wayne and the band knew almost from the beginning that the song could be a hit. The song's hook was created from the lyrics which Wayne got from equating smearing chapstick on your lips to buttering your toast. Wayne's story dispels the rock critic myth that these lyrics were a code for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Greg brings everyone back to the dense sound of {album: Transmissions From the Satellite Heart}. He wonders how Steven came upon the idea layering the heavy "Bonham-esque" drums underneath pop songs. Steven admits that the sound was inspired by {name: Larry Mullen}'s drums on {artist: U2}'s {album: War}.

Greg wonders if the band's next transformation happened after guitarist {name: Ronald Jones} left the band in 1996. Wayne agrees that Ronald's leaving changed the band. Although, Steve adds that he himself was burnt out and heavily into drugs at the time. At this point the Lips re-tooled into the era of their parking lot experiments, boom box experiments and the 1997 release of the four-CD album {album: Zaireeka} -- an album designed for the listener play all four CD's simultaneously on four different sound systems in the same room. Each project was an orchestration of random sounds, a symphony of noise. Wayne wanted to try something new and take a chance.

After the band went through their two year sonic experiment they released the album {album: The Soft Bulletin} in 1999, which Jim considers a {genre: pop} masterpiece. Wayne thinks the signature song from that album is "{track: Race For the Prize}". The song is in reference to two scientists fighting to cure a disease. Also on the album is "{track: Waitin' for a Superman}," inspired by Wayne and his brother jogging around the lake to deal with their father's bout with cancer. These two songs are full of meaningful and heartstung lyrics. Jim pipes in that that Wayne wouldn't have been able to write lyrics like this earlier in the Lip's career. Wayne chalks it up to the experience of life changing you, which changed him and the band for the better.

{era: 2002}'s {album: Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots} is a continuation of the band's lyrical progression, especially with its song "{track: Do You Realize??}" Another key song is "{track: Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1}." (You can hear their live performance here.)

The critical response to these last two albums was, as Jim puts it, "nothing short of ecstatic." The latest album, {era: 2006}'s {album: At War With the Mystics} hasn't seen the same response (including from our own Greg Kot.) Steve and Wayne kind of expected it. They're just as happy to win a {tag: Grammy} for a song titled, "{track: The Wizard Turns On...The Giant Silver Flashlight And Puts On His Werewolf Moccasins}."

## 00:50:29 DIJ: Jim
It's {host: Jim}'s turn to pop a quarter in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. Mr. Kot is pleasantly surprised as Jim reveals his choice: "{track: Credit in the Straight World}" by {artist: Young Marble Giants} from their {era: 1980} album {album: Colossal Youth}. Elements from this {era: late 1970s} {genre: post-punk} band are heard in {genre: orchestral pop} bands such as {artist: Belle and Sebastian}. Even {name: Courtney Love}'s {artist: Hole} covered this song on their {era: 1994} release {album: Live Through This}. Young Marble Giants consisted of female vocalist {name: Alison Statton} and brothers {name: Philip [Moxham]} and {name: Stuart Moxham}. They went against the English {genre: punk} grain at the time by choosing to be quiet and minimalist. The band reunited this past May at {place: England}'s {tag: Hay Festival} for the first time in 27 years.
