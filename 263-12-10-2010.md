# Show 263: The Best Albums of 2010
The end is here! Jim and Greg pick the **Best Albums of 2010**.

## 00:01:53 News: 12.10.2010
![Susan Boye](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2010/susan-boyle.jpg)
Last week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} reviewed the new album by {artist: The Black Eyed Peas}, and this week they were sure it would be a #1 hit. But if there's anyone that can give the Peas a run for their money, it's...{artist: Susan Boyle}? The *{tag: Britain's Got Talent}* winner is the top seller of the week with her new album {album: The Gift}, beating out not only The Black Eyed Peas, but {artist: Kanye West} and {artist: Taylor Swift}. This news is further evidence that the physical album chart is dominated by people who still buy physical albums, a.k.a. "older folks." Which leads to the next story...

{tag: Billboard} has recognized that its standard album chart might not be a fully accurate representation of what's "popular" in music. In today's world, an artist's tweets, followers, fans, friends and hits are just as important indicators as record sales. So with that in mind they've launched the new {tag: Social 50}. At the top of Social 50 are artists like {artist: Rihanna}, {artist:  Justin Bieber}, {artist: Eminem} and {artist: Nicki Minaj} – all performers who sell records. But the chart also has the potential to recognize non-traditional acts like {artist: Widespread Panic}, {artist: Girl Talk} and {artist: Robyn}, who consistently sell out shows, but don't have a big retail presence. Jim and Greg welcome Billboard to the {era: 21st century}.

Still shopping for {tag: holiday} gifts and got a few thousand to spare? Well, you could get your loved one the original lyrics to {artist: Bob Dylan}'s song "{track: The Times They Are a-Changin}." And by a few thousand we mean $300,000. That's how much the sheet of unruled notebook paper is expected to go for at an upcoming auction. December certainly seems to be the month of {genre: rock} memorabilia sales. {artist: Johnny Cash}'s jumpsuit, which he wore during his concert at {place: San Quentin} and made famous in this [image](http://www.penmachine.com/images/cashfinger-big.jpg), went for $50,000. {artist: Michael Jackson}'s glove sold for $300,000, and a decades old legal letter featuring {artist: John Lennon}'s original lyrics to "{track: I'm Only Sleeping}" is expected to go for over $500,000.
