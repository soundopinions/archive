# Show 289: Songs About Dad & Opinions on Raphael Saadiq 
{host: Jim}, {host: Greg} and listener guest critics say Happy {tag: Father's Day} with their favorite {tag: Songs About Dad}.

![Songs About Dad](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2011/fathersday.jpg)

## 00:01:51 List: Songs About Dad
{genre: Rock and roll} is filled with father figures–some dear dads and some deadbeat dads. But the male parent doesn't get nearly as much song time as Mom. So in honor of {tag: Father's Day}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} decide to give the fathers some. Here are their favorite {tag: Songs About Dad}.

### Jim
- {artist: Fire}, "{track: Father's Name Was Dad}"
- {artist: Loretta Lynn}, "{track: Coal Miner's Daughter}"
- {artist: Didjits}, "{track: Dad}"
- {artist: Neil Young}, "{track: Old Man}"

### Greg
- {artist: David Bowie}, "{track: Kooks}"
- {artist: Grateful Dead}, "{track: Box of Rain}"
- {artist: Kelly Hogan}, "{track: Papa Was a Rodeo}"
- {artist: The Winstons}, "{track: Color Him Father}"

### Jim and Greg are joined by guest listener critics who share their song choices:
- Roger from Chapel Hill, NC: {artist: John Hiatt}, "{track: Your Dad Did}"
- Jen from Chicago, IL: {artist: Paul Simon}, "{track: St. Judy's Comet}"
- Andrew from Ft. Wayne, IN: {artist: Lou Reed}, "{track: Beginning Of A Great Adventure}"
- Erin from San Francisco, CA: {artist: Shep and the Limelights}, "{track: Daddy's Home}"

## 00:49:39 Review: Raphael Saadiq 
![Stone Rollin' - Single](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/30/97/78/30977853-e726-6658-2b23-8d237b968fd1/source/600x600bb.jpg "14213/418914236")

{artist: Raphael Saadiq} is a music veteran at age 44. He was a member of the successful {genre: R&B} group {artist: Tony! Toni! Toné!} and then {artist: Lucy Pearl}. Now he's released his fourth solo album called {album: Stone Rollin'}. Jim loves the vibe of it, even {name: Robert Randolph}'s {tag: pedal steel guitar}. You could accuse Saadiq of living in the past–he makes no bones about his roots–but he has the songwriting chops to put behind it. {host: Jim} gives this "great party record" a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} has always respected and liked Saadiq, but on this album he falls in love. He calls this album the singer/songwriter's crowning achievement, adding that Saadiq falls on the right side of the divide between retro and classic. *Stone Rollin'* gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
