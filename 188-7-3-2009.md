Hit the road this summer with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorite Driving Songs.

![Favorite Driving Songs](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2009/driving_songs.jpg)

## 00:01:49 News: 07.03.09
Last week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discussed the death of {genre: pop} icon {artist: Michael Jackson}. But the news surrounding Jackson's death has not stopped. Neither has his impact on the music industry. Just this week Billboard announced that 9 out of 10 slots on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart are Jackson titles. But, while his estate continues to make money, concert promoter {tag: AEG} stands to lose millions. They will be refunding fans that purchased tickets to Jackson's fifty {place: London} shows -- $85 million worth of tickets to be exact.

In other sad music news, {name: Sky Saxon}, leader of the {genre: garage rock} band {artist: The Seeds}, also passed away last week. The news of his death was largely overshadowed by Michael Jackson coverage, so Jim and Greg wanted to pay tribute to Saxon during this episode. He was not a great musician, but had a tremendous attitude and a great impact on {genre: punk} music. They play "{track: Pushin' Too Hard}" in his honor.
