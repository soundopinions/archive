### 00:01:45 In Memoriam: Clyde Stubblefield
![Clyde Stubblefield](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2017/clydestubblefield.jpg)

It's time to give the drummer some. {name: Clyde Stubblefield}, the masterful drummer in {artist: James Brown}'s band, died on February 18 at age 73. By the late '60s, Brown was experimenting with a polyrhythmic sound with a band driven by two drummers. While {name: John "Jabo" Starks} provided the more straightforward {genre: R&B} beat, Stubblefield brought a melodic, {genre: jazz}y touch. His playing defined the {genre: funk} genre through classic tracks like "{track: Cold Sweat}" and "{track: Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud}."

## 00:06:43 Feature: Sample Platter: James Brown's "Funky Drummer"
Stubblefield's drumming also formed the rhythmic basis of {genre: hip-hop}, with his breaks being sampled hundreds of times. Most famously, a few bars of his playing on "{track: Funky Drummer}" from 1970 has become one of the most sampled pieces of music of all time. Jim and Greg do a {tag: Sample Platter}, charting the track's use in dozens of rap and pop hits, from {artist: Public Enemy} to {artist: LL Cool J} to {artist: George Michael}.
