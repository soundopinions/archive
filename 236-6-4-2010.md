# Show 236: The Vocoder & Opinions on Blitzen Trapper and Sleigh Bells
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by {name: Dave Tompkins}, author of {tag: *How to Wreck a Nice Beach*}, a history of the vocoder from World War II to Hip-Hop. Tompkins reveals the instrument's secret military past and funk roots.

## 00:04:54 News: 6.4.2010
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} kick off the show by discussing the results of the biggest pop music contest in the world. No, not {tag: American Idol}...{tag: Eurovision}! That television broadcast drew more than 120 million viewers worldwide (compare with Idol's 24 million) and remains the world's most-watched non-sporting event. {place: Germany} is the big winner this year with its contestant 19-year-old {artist: Lena Meyer-Landrut}. 

## 00:07:45 Special: The History of the Vocoder 
Next {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by {name: Dave Tompkins}, author of {tag: *How to Wreck a Nice Beach: The Vocoder from World War II to Hip-Hop*}. The {tag: vocoder} is an electronic instrument that produces a distorted, robotic sound. You probably recognize it making an appearance in songs like "{track: Trans Europe Express}," or even "{track: I'm Not Moving}," but you probably don't know about its secret military history. It was developed as a tool to encode speech during wartime and was used by {name: Winston Churchill} and {name: Franklin Roosevelt}â€“a far cry from {artist: Afrika Bambaattaa}. As Tompkins explains, there's something the human ear finds undeniably fascinating and pleasurable about machine-like voices. And, ultimately, the technology all stems from a desire to make cheaper phone calls.

## 00:35:51 Review: Blitzen Trapper
![Destroyer of the Void (Bonus Track Version)](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/28/66/f7/2866f78c-d417-f895-87cd-f6c6f0c68672/source/600x600bb.jpg "5028207/372298888")
{artist: Blitzen Trapper} kicks off the reviews this week. Their 5th and latest album is called {album: Destroyer of the Void}. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were big fans of the 2009 {label: Sub Pop} debut {album: Furr}. Greg continues to respect singer {name: Eric Earley}'s songwriting and fondness for traditional American folk sounds. But, he feels like the band is on repeat with this album. It's too predictable and only gets a {tag: Try It} rating from Greg. {host: Jim} can't believe his ears. The moments of departure and growth that Greg loves are the worst parts of the record according to him. Blitzen Trapper is aping {artist: Queen}, and it doesn't work for Jim. It's a "disgrace" and a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:44:31 Review: Sleigh Bells
![Treats](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/26/15/b0/2615b036-e1bf-f487-d78b-b40cdf0fbe9b/source/600x600bb.jpg "370695831/371959684")
{artist: Sleigh Bells} has released its debut record, {album: Treats}. The duo of {tag: guitarist} and beat maker {name: Derek Miller} and {tag: vocalist} {name: Alexis Krauss} made noise at both {place: CMJ} and {place: SXSW}. But to Jim, a self-professed connoisseur of noise, this is too much. Every note is full of massive fuzz and distortion. Everything's at "11," and it gets a {tag: Trash It} from {host: Jim}. {host: Greg} wants us all to note the moment where Jim complained his rock and roll was too loud. It's ear-bleed loud, yes, but it's also a tremendous pop pick-me-up. Greg gives Sleigh Bells a {tag: Buy It}. 

## 00:51:29 DIJ: Jim
It's {host: Jim}'s turn to add a song he can't live without to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} this week. He honors iconic {tag: actor} {name: Dennis Hopper}, who died last week at age 74. Hopper not only directed classic movies like {tag: *Easy Rider*}, he chose their soundtracks. So for his track, Jim chooses "{track: The Ballad of Easy Rider}." The version in the film features a solo performance by {name: Roger McGuinn} of {artist: The Byrds}, but Jim prefers the version by the whole band.
