## 00:49:38 Review: Angel Olsen
![MY WOMAN](https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/24/e4/55/24e455a1-a425-1d1d-5a83-f2db6f514c06/source/600x600bb.jpg "426576022/1115790664")
{album: My Woman} is {artist: Angel Olsen}'s second album for {label: Jagjaguwar}, following 2014's acclaimed {album: Burn Your Fire for No Witness}. The {place: Asheville}-via-{place: St. Louis}-and-{place: Chicago} singer-songwriter is working now with producer {name: Justin Raisen}, known for more pop-oriented work for {artist: Sky Ferreira} and {artist: Charli XCX}. But {host: Greg} says that rather than introduce a pop sheen, Olsen uses Raisen to bring out the drama in her songs. From touches of {genre: goth [rock]} and {genre: glam rock}, Greg is hearing moves Olsen has never used before. He loves that her complicated and disconcerting lyrics are brought to the forefront. {host: Jim} agrees that Olsen is fantastic at confronting difficult emotions in her lyrics. And he loves the unique ambience of her records – he places Angel Olsen's work in the shortlist for best uses of {tag: reverb} of all time. It's a double {tag: Buy It} from both critics.
