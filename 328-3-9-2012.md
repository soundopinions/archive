# Show 328: The Monkees & Reviews of Andrew Bird and Kid Cudi

## 00:01:45 News: 3.9.12
At the top of the show Jim and Greg remember the work of {tag: Oscar-winning} songwriter {artist: Robert Sherman}. A glance at his list of tunes is a reminder that the film business just doesn't value music like it used to. (Think about the paltry two Oscar nominations for Best Original Song this year). After penning some pop hits in the 1950's, Sherman and his brother wrote iconic songs for {tag: *Mary Poppins*} and {tag: *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang*}, in addition to "{track: It's a Small World}." But it's his work for {tag: *The Jungle Book*} and {artist: Louis Prima}'s "{track: I Wan'na Be Like You}," that really brings it all back for Jim. 

While {tag: Apple}'s announcements about the {tag: 3rd generation} of the {tag: iPad} are making big news this week, Jim and Greg turn to their advancements on the music side. Apple's {tag: iTunes} store is slowly making available higher fidelity files mastered for better sound. The company has made new techniques available to producers and engineers to achieve this high quality sound, so it will be interesting to see if artists take advantage of it. And it's heartening to know that in the Convenience Vs. Quality debate, we haven't forgotten about the music.

## 00:08:05 Special: The Monkees
Hey, hey it's {artist: The Monkees}! Jim and Greg go ape on this episode with {name: Eric Lefcowitz}, author of {tag: *Monkee Business: The Revolutionary Made For TV Band*}. Monkees teen icon {name: Davy Jones} died last week at age 66, and so Jim and Greg return to this 2011 conversation. The three men talk about the band's history as a group manufactured to tap into {tag: Beatlemania}. {tag: TV producer}s {name: Bob Rafelson} and {name: Bert Schneider} brought bandmates {name: Micky Dolenz}, {name: Michael Nesmith}, {name: Peter Tork} and {name: Davy Jones} together, and their music was supervised by record {tag: producer} {name: Don Kirshner}. This was the original pop model, giving way to {artist: N'Sync}, {artist: Justin Bieber} and {tag: Glee}. But eventually, as often happens, The Monkees began to itch for independence. They went on to write and produce more of their own music and make the trippy cult classic {tag: *Head*}. And of course, there were a number of reunion efforts in later decades. But, for many their legacy remains those wacky TV moments and classic pop songs.

## 00:41:21 Review: Andrew Bird
![Break It Yourself](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/7c/5d/b3/7c5db33b-4b74-5b8c-81df-21b3a9603809/source/600x600bb.jpg "3883114/970850439")

{artist: Andrew Bird} is back with his 7th studio album called {album: Break It Yourself}. The {tag: singer}, {tag: songwriter} and multi-instrumentalist recorded the album in his barn in western {place: Illinois}, and Greg's favorite track is "{track: Near Death Experience Experience}," which tells the story of people on a plane about to crash. It has a tango groove, emotional intensity and quirkiness. He can't say the same about the rest of the record, unfortunately. {host: Greg} respects Bird, but finds these tunes demonstrate great musicianship, but not great songwriting. So, he says {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} also appreciates how he isn't a cookie cutter conformist, but you have to get past a lot of hurdles to like Bird's music, including whistling, violin and a love for $20 words. While much of that has been pared back, he still isn't drawn into these songs and says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:25 Review: WZRD
![WZRD](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e9/20/85/e92085ca-5b43-b2e2-4bb8-2d4c0bbcce59/source/600x600bb.jpg "498360524/503160720")

{artist: Kid Cudi} made a name for himself first as a protégé of {artist: Kanye West}, then as an innovator of a unique emo-rap sound with {album: Man on the Moon Parts One and Two}. And now he's picked up a guitar. With {artist: WZRD}, his project with {artist: Dot da Genius}, he is fusing elements of hip-hop and rock, and to great effect according to Jim. He admires his cockiness (covering {track: Where Did You Sleep Last Night?}) and his sense of experimentation, especially when compared to unsuccessful fusion efforts like {artist: Lil Wayne}'s {album: Rebirth}. {host: Jim} tells you to {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} only needs to describe {album: WZRD} in two words: Amateur Hour. If he didn't know Cudi was behind this album, he'd instruct these kids to go back to the drawing board, learn to play guitar and learn to sing. Sorry folks, this one's a {tag: Trash It}.
