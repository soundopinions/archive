For every arena rocker and summer festival headliner, there are great, unknown artists. This week hosts {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} highlight these lesser-known gems. Tune in for {tag: Buried Treasures}, plus a review of the latest from veteran singer/songwriter {artist: John Hiatt}.

## 00:01:53 News: 8.19.2011
Frequent concertgoers know that with the good (music and merriment) comes the bad, especially during the summer high season. Just last week news broke about a stage collapse at the {place: Indiana State Fair} {artist: Sugarland} performance, where 5 were killed and dozens more injured. That was a {tag: tragedy} no one could have predicted. But some incidents at shows are merely the result of bad behavior on the part of fans: drinking, drugs, violence and more. And this is a bummer not just for fans, but for artists who depend on touring revenue for their bread and butter and often risk being banned from markets or venues. So what's a rocker to do? {name: John Jurgensen} of the {tag: Wall Street Journal} wrote about the idea of the "{tag: Fan Code of Conduct}," and he talks to Jim and Greg about how performers and fans are working together to make the concert world a better place.

## 00:11:31 List: Buried Treasures

So every once in a while {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} dig into their chest of musical treasures to unearth some records that deserve more attention.

![Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns](http://www.themortonreport.com/2011/06/27/JohnHiattDirtyJeansMudslideHymns.jpg "94328/493319041")

Veteran {tag: singer}/{tag: songwriter} {artist: John Hiatt} has a new album out called {album: Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns}. And like your favorite jeans, there's something comfortable about Hiatt. But, {host: Jim} adds, there's also great depth and poignancy. Just look at the variety of artists who choose to cover Hiatt. He says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} describes Hiatt as amazingly consistent over the years. You can count on a handful of Americana classics sung with a wolfish drawl. But Dirty Jeans is neither great nor terrible. He wishes Hiatt had pushed it further and would recommend you {tag: Burn It}.
