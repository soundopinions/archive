# Show 327: Fred Armisen & Reviews of Bruce Springsteen and Mark Lanegan
Fred Armisen of {tag: *Portlandia*} and {tag: *Saturday Night Live*} talks music and comedy with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}.

## 00:01:44 News: 3.2.2012
{artist: [The] Monkees} fans young and old were sad to learn of the passing of lead singer {name: Davy Jones} at age 66. As {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explain, Jones wasn't much of a singer or musician, but had acting chops and most importantly, charisma. This was fitting for this postmodern band that still polarizes people today. Was he a manufactured pop star or the real deal? Whatever the answer, he will be missed. Jim and Greg play {artist: The Monkees}' last top 10 hit "{track: Valleri}" in remembrance.

## 00:05:40 Interview: Fred Armisen
You know him as Fericito, the Tito Puente-like talk show host on {tag: *Saturday Night Live*} or Spyke, the stretched hipster from {tag: *Portlandia*}. But before {name: Fred Armisen} was a comedian, he was a {genre: punk rock} {tag: drummer}, working with groups like {place: Chicago} band {artist: Trenchmouth}. It was only after spoofing the music industry conference {tag: SXSW} and its "How to Make It"- style seminars that Fred transitioned into comedy. He went on to successful television projects and also produced a hilarious mock drum instruction video and a single by the aging hardcore act {artist: Crisis of Conformity}. He returned to his old {place: Chicago} stomping grounds as part of {tag: Portlandia}'s live tour and spoke with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about the connections between music and humor. For example, musicians and music fans are rife for parody. And, {name: Moammar Gadhafi} is more like a rock star than you might think.

{tag: *Portlandia*} fans should also check out Jim and Greg's [interview](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/311) with {name: Carrie Brownstein} and the members of {artist: Wild Flag}.

## 00:35:21 Review: Bruce Springsteen
![Wrecking Ball (Special Edition)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/52/fc/fb/52fcfb91-9455-d2af-bfb7-6a63d8961afe/source/600x600bb.jpg "178834/824933773")

Get ready for another classic Sound Opinions {artist: Bruce Springsteen} debate. Historically, Greg is in the pro-corner, while Jim is in the con. But, there have been exceptions. And on this 17th release {album: Wrecking Ball}, which is like a soundtrack to {tag: Occupy Wall Street}, {host: Greg} says you lose the songwriter's sense of urgency and anger because of the glossy production. The album goes straight for stadium anthems, so he can only give it a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} thinks he's letting {tag: The Boss} off easy. He compares the performance to that of a bad Irish bar band and says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:45:32 Review: Mark Lanegan
![Blues Funeral](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/35/8d/a0/358da027-062c-c0cc-5250-1e77dc0224e4/source/600x600bb.jpg "480176938/483136233")

Whether it was with the {artist: Screaming Trees}, dueting with {artist: Isobel Campbell} or on his own, {artist: Mark Lanegan} has a tremendous voice. And on his new solo record, {album: Blues Funeral}, he goes for a rootsy sound, but also experiments with more digital production. You might think this would mask his signature "whisky soaked" vocals, but {host: Jim} loves this rainy day mood record and would recommend you {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg}, on the other hand, would take any of Lanegan's other records over this one. He thinks he's gone too far out of his comfort zone and questions some of the clich'ed lyrics. Of {album: Blues Funeral}, Greg says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:50:46 DIJ: Jim
Last month {tag: bassist} {name: Michael Davis} of the legendary {place: Detroit} bands the {artist: MC5} and {artist: Destroy All Monsters} died at age 68. So during this episode {host: Jim} wants to honor him by adding a {era: 1979} Destroy All Monsters track called "{track: Meet the Creeper}" to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. It features Davis on bass along with {name: Ron Asheton} of {artist: The Stooges} and a {tag: lead singer} simply called {name: Niagra}.
