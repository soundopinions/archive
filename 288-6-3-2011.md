## 00:01:53 News: 6.3.2011
{host: Greg} calls {artist: Gil Scott-Heron} one of the most profound artists of the last half-century, and last week he {tag: died} at age 62. The man behind "{track: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised}" began as a {tag: poet}, but was attracted to the way music could reach a larger audience. However, even after signing with {tag: Clive Davis}, he never abandoned his politics. Scott-Heron fused biting commentary with powerful beats and arrangements. It was a sound that {tag: inspired} many {genre: hip-hop} artists, though he rejected that association. To remember Gil Scott-Heron, {host: Jim} and Greg play one of his near-hits called "{track: Johannesburg}" from 1975.

## 00:06:29 Special: Bob Dylan
![moderntimes](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2011/ModernTimes.jpg)
During this episode {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wrap up our series on {artist: Bob Dylan} and bring it up to "Modern Times". How, you may ask, can they gloss over the {era: '70s} and {era: '80s} so cavalierly? Trust that it was difficult to narrow down Dylan's entire canon to three episodes. And it's important to note that Dylan is one of those rare artists who emerged in the {era: '60s} and was still making great, new music into his sixties. So that's why our hosts decided to bring it up to {tag: Act III: 1989-2006}. Dylan was in amazing form live and released a string of impressive albums including {album: Oh Mercy}, {album: Time Out of Mind} and {album: Modern Times}. He collaborated with {tag: producer} {name: Daniel Lanois} and also worked with Jim and Greg's guest this week, {tag: engineer} **{name: Mark Howard}**. Howard gives us a sneak peek into what it's like to record with Dylan.

As always Jim and Greg like to round out these features by highlighting significant tracks. Greg chooses an unreleased version of "{track: Mississippi}," later put out on {album: The Bootleg Series Vol. 8.} A highly produced version appears on 2001's {album: Love and Theft}, but Greg prefers the more stripped down recording, calling the performance fascinating. And he notes that Dylan draws from older material for inspiration just like he did when he was starting out as a folkie.

Jim admits that he prefers Dylan live during these years. But "{track: Ain't Talkin}'" from {album: Modern Times} in 2006 is perfectly simple and spookyâ€“just a fiddle, percussion and that signature voice. This is a song Dylan couldn't have given justice in his younger days.

## 00:48:56 Review: My Morning Jacket
![Circuital](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/17/58/e2/1758e2b5-a33f-0a38-2f5d-8ca3e005057d/source/600x600bb.jpg "2322618/436028007")
{artist: My Morning Jacket}'s new album is {album: Circuital}, a nod to the band's desire to return to its roots. The {place: Louisville} quintet has a huge touring fan base these days, but their experimentation has sometimes taken them away from their original {artist: Neil Young}-{tag: influenced} sound. {host: Greg} appreciates their attempt to make a more cohesive album, and he really thought they got it...until he got to side two. Things totally fall apart there, so Greg can only recommend that people {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} thinks even that rating is kind. He wonders how cartoonish music has to be to get passed up by the makers of the new {tag: Muppet} movie. Jim says {tag: Trash It}.
