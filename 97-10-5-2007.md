# Show 97: The Replacements' Let It Be (Classic Album Dissection) & Opinions on Steve Earle 
It's time for another Sound Opinions Classic Album Dissection. This time Jim and Greg discuss The Replacements' masterpiece "Let It Be" with Jim Walsh, author of "The Replacements: All Over But the Shouting."

## 00:04:04 News: 10.05.07
In the news this week is {artist: Radiohead}'s decision to independently release its first studio album since 2003 as a pay-what-you-wish download. The announcement has sparked interest among fans and industry analysts alike, and Jim and Greg are eager to see how this experiment works out. When {name: Thom Yorke} and {name: Jonny Greenwood} were on the show last year, they discussed their hope to step outside the traditional record industry model, but they didn't seem to know how or when they would do it. And how Radiohead succeeds with releasing their album this way will be telling for other labels and bands who are looking for an alternative to the overpriced plastic disc.

Another story getting headlines is the {name: Phil Spector} murder trial. Four years ago the legendary producer was charged with murdering actress {name: Lana Clarkson}, and last week the jury announced it was deadlocked. It will be months before a new trial is launched in {place: Los Angeles}, but with so much negative attention focused on Spector, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wanted to take this opportunity to discuss his legacy as a producer. He's had a history of violence, but, as Greg explains, he also completely reinvented music production. Using heavy orchestrations, layers of sound, and booming echoes of instrumentation, Spector created the "{tag: Wall of Sound}" effect for groups like {artist: The Ronettes}, {artist: The Beach Boys} and {artist: The Beatles}. Jim and Greg end the conversation with a great example of this sound-"{track: River Deep, Mountain High}" by {artist: Ike and Tina Turner}.

## 00:21:45 Classic Album Dissection: Let It Be
![Let It Be (Expanded Edition)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f6/d3/0b/f6d30bab-bec1-e04d-13b6-7a4ff5694f25/source/600x600bb.jpg "206276/290652234")
This week's feature is a {tag: Classic Album Dissection} of {artist: The Replacements}' {era: 1984} release {album: Let It Be}. Unlike previously dissected albums like {album: Revolver} and {album: Songs in the Key of Life}, {album: Let It Be} wasn't a major critical or commercial success. But, Jim and Greg believe it's one of the greatest albums ever made. It was the fourth album from the {place: Minneapolis} band, which was comprised of four "scruffy" members: {name: Paul Westerberg}, {name: Bob Stinson}, {name: Tommy Stinson} and {name: Chris Mars}. As Jim and Greg explain, this album put the band on the map and helped to define what we know today as "indie music." To learn more about the making of {album: Let It Be} and why it's so special, Jim and Greg talk with longtime Minneapolis music journalist {name: Jim Walsh} who has written an oral history of the band called "{tag: The Replacements: All Over But the Shouting}."

Jim, Greg and Jim Walsh discuss what a radical change {album: Let It Be} was for {artist: The Replacements}. While their previous albums were dominated by noisy, silly tracks, this recording sprinkled those trademark Replacements songs ("{track: Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out}," "{track: Gary's Got a Boner}") with more mature, heartfelt songs penned by Paul Westerberg. An example of this is the track "{track: Unsatisfied}," which Jim and Greg both believe is the highlight of {album: Let It Be}. Greg describes the song as "emotional bloodletting," and an indication of how much Westerberg had grown as a songwriter. He also points out how inventive the instrumentation, which includes 12-string and lap steel guitar, was for the band and {genre: punk} music in general. Jim calls "{track: Unsatisfied}" the "{track: Satisfaction}" of the {genre: post-punk} generation. The song asks a question everyone can relate to: "Is this all there is in life?" But, as Jim notes, there was more in store for {artist: The Replacements} after the release of {album: Let It Be}. It cemented them as an important band in {genre: rock} {tag: history}, and even though Westerberg and the band didn't go on to achieve similar greatness, {album: Let It Be} will go down as one of the great albums in the rock canon.

## 00:48:32 Review: Steve Earle
![Washington Square Serenade](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/be/67/96/be67966a-c364-1706-6e16-0fbe380e6ec0/source/600x600bb.jpg "71239/508999789")
The album up for review this week is {album: Washington Square Serenade} by veteran roots-rocker {artist: Steve Earle}. This is Earle's 12th studio album, and was partly inspired by his 7th wife. The singer/songwriter has always combined {genre: rock}, {genre: folk} and {genre: country} with strong political messages, but, now he's adding "happiness" to the mix. As you can hear in many of the album's songs, Earle is very much in love with new wife Allison Moorer, who also appears on the record. Another new person in Earle's life is {artist: Dust Brothers} {tag: producer} {name: John King}, who has previously crafted albums for {artist: Beck} and the {artist: Beastie Boys}. King brought in elements of {genre: hip hop} and {genre: Latin} music, and {host: Jim} loves the results. It took him longer to get into Washington Square Serenade, than any other Earle album, but with the exception of two bum tracks, he gives it a {tag: Try It}. Greg is less pleased with the happy Steve Earle. He explains that with the new wife, producer and location, this effort has all the trappings of a "mid-life crisis" recording. Only some of it works for {host: Greg}, and he misses the political broadsides of previous albums. Greg also gives Washington Square Serenade a {tag: Try It}.
