# Show 287: Mike Watt & Opinions on Lady Gaga and Death Cab for Cutie
{artist: Mike Watt} of the {place: California} {genre: punk} band {artist: The Minutemen} talks about the band's history, legacy and influential album {album: Double Nickels on the Dime}.

## 00:01:52 News: 5.27.2011
Last week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} said they were waiting for the big zeppelin to head to the clouds. That'd be {tag: Apple}, and this week it did. Apple has entered the final stages of negotiations with the {tag: major record labels} and {tag: music publishers} for a service that will allow people to upload and store their music on the web and listen to it on any of their devices. Unlike its competitors {tag: Amazon} and {tag: Google}, who beat Apple to the punch, {tag: iCloud} is in cooperation with the big labels. Because of this and because of iTunes' already huge user base, Apple may again become king of the clouds.

{tag: LimeWire} has agreed to pay $105 million to a group of {tag: major record labels} in an out-of-court settlement over {tag: piracy}. The {tag: file-sharing site} was one of the biggest and received a court order to shut down last year. The {tag: RIAA} has been going through sites like LimeWire one by one, and with success. But the rate of file-sharing hasn't slowed. And the real question is if any of the musicians "infringed" upon will actually receive this bounty.

{tag: The Smoking Gun} has revealed surprising demands in pop singer {artist: Katy Perry}'s {tag: concert rider}. We suppose it makes sense to ban conversations with chauffeurs. And of course you'd need specially designed furniture. But no carnations! Actually, the biggest revelation concerned the icky practice of ticket re-selling. Perry's camp reserves the right to require promoters to hold back tickets to be re-sold on the secondary market. In other words, Katy Perry may {tag: scalp} her own {tag: tickets}. Jim and Greg spoke to {tag: Wall Street Journal} reporter {name: Ethan Smith} about this topic a couple of years ago, but laying out these plans in plain words on a contract is on a whole new level. It makes you yearn for the days of M&M demands.

## 00:08:47 Interview: Mike Watt
![doublenicklesonthedime](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2011/doublenickelsonthedime.jpg)
By the early {era: 1980's}, {genre: punk} had become less about sticking it to the man, and more about conforming to a set of rules. Then came {artist: The Minutemen} with {album: Double Nickels on the Dime}, the {era: 1984} album that threw out the punk rulebook. This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by Minutemen bassist {name: Mike Watt}, who founded the {place: San Pedro} {genre: hardcore} group alongside drummer {name: George Hurley} and larger-than-life lead singer and guitarist {name: D. Boon}. The Minutemen weren't afraid to experiment with their sound, incorporating {genre: jazz} and {genre: funk}, as well as "Econo"—a lo-fi, DIY attitude that would later inspire {genre: indie rock}. Ever the motor-mouth philosopher, Watt waxes poetic about jamming econo, the true meaning of "Double Nickels on the Dime," and his idea of a "Hot Topic."

## 00:42:26 Review: Lady Gaga
![Born This Way](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/b9/d2/e8/b9d2e809-eb0b-d2df-193b-5bc99b5e5ecf/source/600x600bb.jpg "277293880/902096524")
There's a new hit {genre: pop} album with {genre: Euro-pop} dance beats and controversial lyrics designed to tweak the {tag: Catholic Church}. Sound familiar? No, it's not {artist: Madonna}, but {artist: Lady Gaga} and her new album {album: Born This Way}. She might be the biggest star in the world right now, but she still has some surprises in her–including a fondness for '{era: 80s} {genre: hair metal} bombast. {host: Jim} was disappointed to hear {artist: Clarence Clemons} on {tag: sax} and {name: Mutt Lange} on {tag: production}. He was further disappointed to hear the amount of over-singing. Jim wanted to love *Born This Way*, but it's a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} agrees that the record is totally overblown. It's like Gaga on steroids, and unfortunately, never lets up. A few standout tracks will work pounding in a stadium or club, but as an album, he'd just say {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:49:31 Review: Death Cab for Cutie
![Codes and Keys (Deluxe)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/b1/69/61/b1696173-5ee7-c297-b581-e3f727bb8321/source/600x600bb.jpg "5448636/966388650")
{artist: Death Cab for Cutie} also has a new album out called {album: Codes and Keys}. It's been only three years since {album: Narrow Stairs} in 2008, but lead singer {name: Ben Gibbard } has a whole new outlook on life. He's become Mr. {name: Zooey Deschanel}, and he's become {tag: sober}. But Greg insists that the lyrics still express a lot of anxiety, mostly about the idea of "home." {host: Greg} also notes the wonderful sonic experimentation courtesy of band member and {tag: producer} {name: Chris Walla}. In fact, this was their {artist: [Brian] Eno}-inspired album, much to {host: Jim}'s delight. He hears a much happier Gibbard, nothing like the emo-sap that repelled Summer from {tag: *The O.C.*} Both critics give *Codes and Keys* a {tag: Buy It}.
