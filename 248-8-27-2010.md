## 00:01:53 News: 8.27.2010
{tag: Songwriter} {artist: George David Weiss} died this week at age 89. He's behind some of music's most iconic tunes including "{track: Can't Help Falling In Love}," "{track: What a Wonderful World}" and "{track: The Lion Sleeps Tonight}." 

There was actually some controversy surrounding who actually wrote "The Lion Sleeps Tonight," and Weiss would go on to tackle some of these ownership issues as the {tag: president} of the {tag: Songwriters Guild of America}. Jim thinks a great way to remember this "old-school" talent is by listening to {artist: The Flaming Lips}' completely un-ironic version of "{track: What a Wonderful World}."

## 00:08:07 Special: Summer Road Trip
What better way to round out the summer than with a Sound Opinions (virtual) summer road trip. Too often, New York, L.A. and Nashville get all the music industry attention. But, there are great rock scenes all across the country, so this week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} check in with insiders in three music towns coast-to-coast. They talk to {name: Sam Sessa}, an {tag: entertainment writer} for the {tag: Baltimore Sun} and the host of {tag: WTMD}'s {tag: *Balitmore Unsigned*}, {name: Bob Mehr}, a {tag: music critic} at {tag: Memphis' Commercial Appeal} and {name: Casey Jarman}, the {tag: music editor} at Portland's weekly newspaper the {tag: Willamette Week}.

## 00:45:41 Review: Isobel Campbell and Mark Lanegan
![Hawk](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/81/f0/6e/81f06e67-1eb8-021f-b107-a46ec7f3819e/source/600x600bb.jpg "4996189/716638240")
Next up a Beauty and the Beast duo (other than {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}): {artist: Isobel Campbell}, formerly of {artist: Belle and Sebastian} and {artist: Mark Lanegan}, formerly of {artist: the Screaming Trees.} {album: Hawk} is their third collaboration of pop music in the vein of {artist: Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra} or {artist: Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg}. Campbell steers this ship, and Greg is happy to hear her stretch out more with the compositions and arrangements. There are even some soul and gospel references. Greg gives it a {tag: Buy It}. Jim agrees about the rating, but thinks this release is the least successful of the three, and wishes they'd stretched out more.

## 00:51:03 DIJ: Greg
Naturally Hawk got Greg jonesing for some Sinatra/Hazelwood. In the '{era: 60s} {tag: arranger} and {tag: songwriter} {artist: Lee Hazelwood} took {artist: Nancy Sinatra} under his wing and turned her into a feminist icon. While father Frank wasn't crazy about the relationship, and Greg admits the sound was at times creepy, he really digs tracks like "{track: Some Velvet Morning}," and takes it with him this week to the {tag: desert island}.
