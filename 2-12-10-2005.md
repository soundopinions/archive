# Show 2: Top 10 Albums of 2005
It's the moment of truth: Jim and Greg run down their top ten albums released in 2005.

![2005](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2005/2005mus.jpg)

## 00:01:41 Interview: Top Albums of 2005
The "Best Records" list: It's "a sacred thing" in pop music fandom, says Jim, requiring a discerning ear and laser-like focus. Thankfully, our hosts are here to help. After sifting through hundreds of records, and countless days spent listening (perhaps to the discontent of their wives), they've managed to pick out their absolute favorites. Here's what Jim and Greg say they'll still be listening to in 2006.

### Greg
1. Kanye West's latest record takes the number one spot on Greg's list. 
![Late Registration](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2005/latereg.jpg) 
{artist: Kanye West}, {album: Late Registration}. (It was a contender for Jim's number-one slot too, but ended up at number three.) Greg notes how West has mass crossover appeal, but doesn't shy away from topics like [diamond mining](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kanyewest/diamondsfromsierraleone.html) or [AIDS](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-heard-em-say-lyrics#note-40321), or from complex compositions and elaborate string orchestrations courtesy of producer {name: Jon Brion}. Greg really enjoyed West's first album {album: The College Dropout}, but applauds him for taking more chances on this second effort.
2. {artist: LCD Soundsystem}, {album: LCD Soundsystem}. Jim and Greg are in total agreement on their number-two record of the year: {album: LCD Soundsystem}. The group's self-titled double album is an irresistible mix of {genre: electronic} {genre: dance} music, {genre: garage rock} and {genre: punk}. Heading up LCD Soundsystem is {name: James Murphy}, an in-demand producer who, along with partner {name: Tim Goldsworthy}, runs the {label: DFA} label. While Murphy has produced hits for {artist: Britney Spears} and {artist: Le Tigre} and has provided a home to bands like {artist: Rapture} and {artist: The Juan Maclean}, it is perhaps his unintimidating physical appearance, Jim suggests, that accounts for his appeal. Or maybe it's the [cowbell](http://youtu.be/38nTtYxFHjs?t=3m8s). Either way they love it.
3. {artist: Sleater-Kinney}, {album: The Woods}. Sleater-Kinney, an {genre: indie-rock} trio from {place: Portland}, has been facing the same issue as {artist: Moby} (see below): Are they over the hill? Heck no, Greg confidently responds. He believes that {tag: singer}/{tag: guitarist}s {name: Corin Tucker} and {name: Carrie Brownstein} and {tag: drummer} {name: Janet Weiss} have done their best work on {album: The Woods}, an album {tag: produced} by {artist: The Flaming Lips} recording guru {name: Dave Fridmann}. Incidentally, Sleater-Kinney opened for the Lips and {artist: Wilco} at {place: Madison Square Garden} last {tag: New Year's Eve}. Jim, however, is not a fan of Sleater-Kinney... to say the least. {album: The Woods} didn't even make his top 400.
4. {artist: The New Pornographers}, {album: Twin Cinema}. This Canadian {genre: power pop} band gets its name from a comment from {name: Jimmy Swaggart} in which he [likened](http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-03/entertainment/ca-1235_1_swaggart) pop music to a new kind of pornography. {album: Twin Cinema} is the group's third release, and Greg's favorite. Band leader {name: A.C. Newman} is back with {name: Neko Case}, a superb {tag: Chicago}-based singer, and fellow singer/songwriter {name: Dan Bejar}. Greg compares Newman and Bejar's competitive relationship to that of {name: McCartney} and {name: Lennon}, or {name: Grant Hart} and {name: Bob Mould} of {artist: Hüsker Dü}. To fuel that creative fire, Bejar also brought his own band, {artist: Destroyer}, on the New Pornographer's current tour. While listening to this segment, don't miss Greg's helpful explanation of what a song's "bridge" is.
5.{artist: Amadou and Mariam}, {album: Dimanche à Bamako}. This {tag: blind} husband and wife team joined up with {name: Manu Chao}, a {place: Paris}ian born artist of {place: Spanish} descent who gained great popularity in the {genre: Latino} {genre: Indie} music scene for this album, which Jim admits he completely overlooked.  

### Jim
1. We come to Jim's favorite album of 2005: {artist:Common}'s {album: Be}. 
![Be](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2005/commonbe.jpg) 
Before he and Greg are accused of homerism, Jim is quick to note that fellow {place: Chicago} native Common is the only artist to receive four stars from Jim this year. He calls {album: Be} a near-perfect record. Greg agrees and compares this "ghetto symphony" to {artist: Marvin Gaye}'s classic {album: What's Going On}. The album was produced by the aforementioned {artist: Kanye West}, but is not as lush or orchestrated as {album: Late Registration}. Rather, it's a back-to-basics album full of Common's signature flow.
2. {artist: LCD Soundsystem}, {album: LCD Soundsystem}
3. {artist: Kanye West,} {album: Late Registration}
4. {artist: The Go! Team}, {album: Thunder, Lightning, Strike}. The group is helmed by English basement musician {name: Ian Parton} who has been influenced by everything from {artist: Vincent Guaraldi'}s music for the Charlie Brown cartoons to {artist: My Bloody Valentine} to {tag: Bollywood}. Jim's love of this band was solidified after seeing them at Pitchfork's Intonation Festival this past summer in {place: Chicago}.
5.{artist: Moby}, {album: Hotel}. The {genre: electronic pop} artist turned 40 this year (that's 100 in rave time, according to our host), and Jim suspects that many people think he's over the hill. That's not the case though, he asserts, adding that {artist: Moby} is doing post-alternative, underground music better than newer bands like {artist: Interpol} and {artist: The Rapture}. The two-disc album comes on one CD completely comprised of instrumental music. This is perfect, Jim suggests, for reading columns by your two favorite rock critics.
6. {artist: Ladytron}, {album: The Witching Hour}. {album: The Witching Hour} is the third release for the {place: Liverpool}-based group. Jim appreciates Ladytron's infusion of {artist: Kraftwerk}-type {genre: electronica} with more poppy, {genre: disco} sounds. Comprised of two men and two women, they are like {artist: ABBA}, he notes, only with less sunny lyrics.
