# Show 488: Hal Blaine and Opinions on Courtney Barnett

![halblaine](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/halblaine_web.jpg)

Drummer {name: Hal Blaine} has played on countless hit records as part of the famed group of studio musicians known as the {tag: Wrecking Crew}. He speaks with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about recording with {artist: [Frank] Sinatra}, {artist: The Beach Boys}, {artist: Simon & Garfunkel}, and more. Plus, {artist: Australia}n up-and-comer {artist: Courtney Barnett}.


## 00:02:26 News: 04.03.15
{artist: Jay Z} just launched his music streaming service, {tag: Tidal}, to the public. {artist: Kanye West}, {artist: Madonna} and {artist: Daft Punk} were just a few of the artists who attended a press conference to announce their support for the service. According to emphatic speaker {artist: Alicia Keys}, Tidal's mission is to give artists more control over how their music is distributed while taking some of the authority out of the hands of tech companies. The basic monthly fee is $9.99, while the premium, {tag: hi-fi} subscription is $19.99. It will be interesting to see how the service will compete with giants like {tag: Spotify} and Beats, or fellow artist {artist: Garth Brooks}' brand {tag: Ghost Tunes}.

This year {tag: Lollapalooza} Festival is being anchored by a {artist: Beatle[s]}. {artist: Paul McCartney} is one of the Lolla {era: 2015} headliners, which also includes {artist: Metallica}, {artist: Florence + the Machine}, {artist: Sam Smith}, {artist: Alabama Shakes} and {artist: The Weeknd}. This will be McCartney's first stint at Lollapalooza, though he previously played at {tag: Bonnaroo} in {era: 2013}.

In other festival news, if you're planning on getting a pass, don't bring your {tag: selfie stick}. Lollapalooza and {tag: Coachella} have banned the photographic aids from the grounds as the monopods often block the views of other concertgoers and could be potentially dangerous. However rest assured, you can still take pictures and selfies as long as you use your arms like a normal person.

## 00:07:34 Interview: Hal Blaine of The Wrecking Crew
![halblainealbum](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/halblainealbum.jpg)
{name: Hal Blaine} may not be a household name, but if {genre: rock 'n' roll} is all about the beat, then the 86-year-old drummer is arguably one of the biggest rock stars alive. It's his stamp you hear on some of the biggest records of the 1960's and early '70s. He recorded with {artist: Elvis [Presley]}, {artist: The Mamas and the Papas}, {artist: Sam Cooke}, {artist: Simon & Garfunkel}, {artist: The Carpenters}, {artist: Jan and Dean} and even {artist: Barbra Streisand}. That's 38 chart-toppers to be exact, and over 5,000 songs. So if we're comparing successful outputs, that really makes his only rival {artist: The Beatles}!

Of course the idea of a session musician is something we're familiar with today, but many listeners can probably still remember their own revelation that their favorite acts might not have played their own songs. You expect that of {artist: The Monkees}, but {artist: The Beach Boys}? {artist: The Byrds}? Many of their songs were actually recorded by Hal Blaine and {tag: The Wrecking Crew} â€“ a loose organization of {place: California} studio players whose members included {name: Glen Campbell}, {name: Leon Russell}, {name: Earl Palmer} and more. There was an unspoken pact to keep their hit-making machine a secret, but as time has gone on, they've gotten their due. Hal Blaine was inducted into the {tag: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} in 2000, and last month saw the release of {tag: *The Wrecking Crew*}, a new documentary directed by {name: Denny Tedesco}, son of crew guitarist {name: Tommy Tedesco}. 


## 00:43:11 Review: Courtney Barnett
![Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Music1/v4/10/d3/f1/10d3f1ab-058e-eb62-31d9-d2f27e63d2c8/SIJS-2400.600x600-75.jpg "479276137/956894672")
 {place: Australia}n singer-songwriter {artist: Courtney Barnett} has garnered attention over the last few years on the strength of a few buzzed-about EPs. She made a big splash at this year's {tag: SXSW} and now has a proper album out called {album: Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit}. {host: Greg} loves how Barnett takes everyday details and turns them into incisive songs filled with fleshed out characters. She's also a fantastic {tag: guitar} player with a distinctive rhythm/lead style. It's one of the best collection of songs Greg has heard in years. {host: Jim} compares Barnett to {name: Kurt Cobain} in her ability to mix the power of rock with the intricacy of pop melodies. Like Greg, he proclaims it one of the best albums of the year so far. Both critics give Courtney Barnett a {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:51:08 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} was inspired by a conversation he had at {tag: SXSW} with a fan of {artist: The Roches}, a sister group from {place: New York City} in the {era: late '70s}/{era: early '80s}. While {place: British} female-led {genre: post-punk} bands like {artist: The Slits} and {artist: The Raincoats} are celebrated, their American counterparts like The Roches are often overlooked. Sisters {name: Maggie [Roche]}, {name: Terre [Roche]}, and {name: Suzzy Roche} began singing Christmas carols door-to-door, but were later recruited by {artist: Paul Simon} to sing backup vocals. They had an artier, weirder strain than most others in the {genre: folk} scene, with lyrics that could be very funny or extremely poignant. {name: Robert Fripp} of {artist: King Crimson} became a huge fan and produced two of their records. Fripp's guitar line on "{track: Losing True}" combines with the sisters' rich vocals to create what Greg calls a celestial sound, landing it a spot in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
