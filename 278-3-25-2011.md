# Show 278: SXSW 2011 & Opinions on The Strokes 
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} made it back from their annual trip to the {tag: SXSW Music Festival} in {place: Austin, TX}. They'll share their new discoveries for the year to come.

## 00:01:45 News: 3.25.2011
![Pinetop Perkins](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2011/pinetopperkins.jpg)
{genre: Blues} {tag: piano} player {artist: Pinetop Perkins} {tag: passed away} this week at age 97. He was one of the last links to the {place: Mississippi Delta} blues era. As {host: Greg} relays, Perkins made his mark as a sideman for people like {artist: Muddy Waters}. It wasn't until he was 75 that he released an album under his own name. He even holds the record for oldest {tag: Grammy winner}. Pinetop Perkins was going strong right up until his death, so to honor him, {host: Jim} and Greg play the song that gave him his name, "{track: Pinetop's Boogie Woogie}," recorded at {place: Sun Studios} in {tag: 1953}.

## 00:06:08 List: SXSW 2011
Music fans and industry insiders have been gathering at the {tag: SXSW Music and Media Conference} in {place: Austin, TX} for twenty-five years. While it has gotten too big for its britches in recent years, {tag: SXSW} remains the place to hear new artists and issues facing the business. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} didn't have high hopes for this year's {tag: keynote speaker} {name: Bob Geldof}. What has the {artist: Boomtown Rats} done for us lately? Well, not much. But he provided one of the most insightful keynotes our hosts have ever heard. Geldof, who brought the world {tag: Live Aid}, encouraged American musicians to wake up. He explained that {genre: rock 'n' roll} needs to be against something â€“ whether that's in reality or in spirit. Another noteworthy panel featured independent concert promoters from around the country, as well as {tag: Ticketmaster} {tag: CEO} {name: Nathan Hubbard}. The Ticketmaster/{tag: Live Nation} {tag: merger} was approved last year, and this panel attempted to find out how that has affected the concert industry. There were no concrete answers; ticket prices have skyrocketed but it's too early to attribute this to consolidation.

It's panels by day and music by night. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} always return from {tag: SXSW} with a truckload of new music. Here are their respective {tag: discoveries} of artists to watch in {tag: 2011}.

### Jim
- {artist: Le Butcherettes}
- {artist: Bewitched Hands}
- {artist: Esben and the Witch}
- {artist: Dominique Young Unique}

### Greg
- {artist: Glasser}
- {artist: PS I Love You}
- {artist: tUne-YarDs}
- {artist: Wild Flag}

## 00:48:15 Review: The Strokes
![Angles](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/13/44/88/13448800-3f80-4e3a-b8b0-9759a025d268/source/600x600bb.jpg "560289/420041733")
{artist: The Strokes} hit it big in 2001 by asking the question "{track: Is This It}?" And it seems that it was (couldn't resist). They released two underwhelming subsequent records and then went their separate ways. Now the group is more of a democracy, but the missteps {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} heard on {name: Julian Casablancas}' solo album {album: Phrazes For the Young} are evident on The Strokes' new album {album: Angles}. Jim calls it glossy and overproduced, and wonders where {name: Fabrizio Moretti}'s terrific {tag: drumming} is. But worse, the band sounds "artistically bankrupt." He says {tag: Trash It}. Greg is not so disappointed. Ultimately *Angles* is a failed record, but it tries new things and is more interesting for it. He is optimistic about the future and says {tag: Burn It}.
