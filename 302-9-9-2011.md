# Show 302: Iron and Wine & Wild Flag Review

## 00:01:44 News: 9.9.2011
It's always interesting to see what the Brits pick as the winner of the {tag: Mercury Prize}. The almost 20-year old award grants a lb20,000 prize to an act from the {place: U.K.} or {place: Ireland}. And unlike many of our awards, the Mercury usually recognizes unique artists rather than popular ones. This year's winner is {artist: PJ Harvey}, making her the first person to take home a Mercury Prize twice. Her first win was for 2001's {album: Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea}, an album Jim and Greg loved, unlike this year's {album: Let England Shake}. They gave it Burn It and Trash It ratings.

Despite Jim and Greg's review of {artist: Lil Wayne}'s new album {album: Tha Carter IV}, sales approached 1 million records in the first week. It also broke {tag: iTunes} single-week record. {name: Weezy} is contributing to what's proving to be a successful year for the music industry, thanks to a couple of factors. First, retailers discounted the prices of back catalog items, encouraging consumers to go out and shop. In addition, digital sales are up, perhaps because consumers couldn't rely on {tag: LimeWire} for their free goods.

Legendary guitar manufacturer {tag: Gibson} (of {tag: Les Paul} fame) has been catching the attention of the {tag: US government}. Recently their factory was searched by agents of the {tag: US Fish and Wildlife Service} looking for illegally obtained {tag: exotic hardwoods}. This is the second raid in two years, but Gibson denies any wrongdoing. The {tag: Rainforest Alliance} and {tag: Greenpeace} also give the company good marks. But, since recording this episode, this story has gone political. Gibson's {tag: CEO} has taken to conservative airwaves and become a symbol for anti-big government and pro-"Made in the USA" proponents.

## 00:09:14 Interview: Iron and Wine
Next up, {artist: Iron and Wine} join Jim and Greg in the studio. The band began as a lo-fi 4-track project for {genre: folk} {tag: singer}/{tag: songwriter} {name: Sam Beam}. Today, he works with a full band and is selling out shows across the country. Many listeners may also be familiar with Iron and Wine through their contributions to soundtracks like {tag: *Garden State*}, {tag: *Twilight*} and {tag: *Grey's Anatomy*}. Iron and Wine's most recent album is {album: Kiss Each Other Clean}, which was {tag: produced} by {name: Brian Deck}. As Sam explains to Jim and Greg, it's a more pop-driven record, inspired by his own early experiences falling in love with music like {artist: Fleetwood Mac}. But, he didn't abandon his lyrical style, one that is often inspired by the {tag: Bible}. Check out Iron and Wine's live performance and [video](https://vimeo.com/groups/205284).

## 00:43:45 Review: Wild Flag
![Wild Flag (Bonus Track Version)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/fb/48/ca/fb48ca9b-0cb6-983d-7286-8395161de3a3/source/600x600bb.jpg "75290952/451157831")
"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wild-flag-bonus-track-version/id451157831?uo=4")
Ever since seeing them perform at this year's {tag: SXSW} conference, Jim and Greg have been eagerly awaiting the self-titled debut from indie supergroup {album: Wild Flag}. And now that it's here, they aren't disappointed. The band is comprised of {name: Janet Weiss} and {name: Carrie Brownstein}, of {artist: Sleater-Kinney}, {name: Mary Timony} formerly of {artist: Helium} and a number of solo projects, and {name: Rebecca Cole} formerly of {artist: The Minders}. {host: Greg} describes the songs as intense as Sleater-Kinney, but with more joy and a sense of abandonment. He's especially in awe of Weiss' drumming. {host: Jim} also loves {artist: Wild Flag}, but for different reasons. For him Sleater-Kinney was lacking in melodies, something these songs have in spades thanks to Timony, who he calls an {genre: indie rock} Stevie Nicks. Wild Flag gets a double {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:50:10 DIJ: Greg
The harmony vocals on Wild Flag's record inspired Greg to give the backup singer some. And there's no better backup singing group than {artist: The Pips}. Everyone, Jim and Greg included, wanted to be as cool as The Pips. Their music with {artist: Gladys Knight} epitomized what was great about the golden era of {genre: soul} musicâ€”not just sophisticated songwriting, but sophisticated arrangements that were influenced by the call and response style of {genre: gospel} music. Greg chooses to add their hit song "{track: Midnight Train to Georgia}" to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, which incidentally is an improvement from the original title "Midnight Train to Houston."
