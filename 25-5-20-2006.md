# Show 25: 'Revolver' Classic Album Dissection & The Raconteurs Review
This year marks the 40th anniversary of one of the greatest albums of all time--Revolver. Jim and Greg will dissect this Beatles masterpiece and talk with the man who engineered it. Plus, they'll review albums from singer/songwriter T-Bone Burnett and indie rock supergroup The Raconteurs.

![Revolver](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2006/revolver.jpg)

## 00:03:13 News: 05-20-06
The {tag: Payola} investigation conducted by {place: New York} Attorney General {name: Eliot Spitzer} is making some headway. {label: Universal Music Group}, the world's biggest music company, has agreed to pay $12 million to settle accusations that its executives paid radio programmers to play certain songs. This is the largest settlement of its kind. {label: Warner Music Group} and {label: Sony BMG} made similar deals last year, and Mr. Spitzer is still in the process of investigating {label: EMI}, as well as radio companies like {tag: Clear Channel} and {tag: CBS Radio}. And, as we [heard](/show/22/) a couple of weeks ago, the {tag: FCC} is conducting a similar inquiry. As always, Sound Opinions H.Q. will keep you posted. 

Another story in the news this week suggests that record company lawyers won't be taking a break any time soon. All four of the major record labels have just launched a lawsuit against {tag: XM Satellite Radio}. {label: Universal}, {label: Sony BMG}, {label: Warner} and {label: EMI} all claim that a new XM device called the "{tag: Inno}" violates music copyright law by allowing people to not only listen to satellite radio, but record it. Therefore, according to the labels, XM has become a digital retailer, like iTunes, and should be required to pay similar fees. It's yet another example of the recording industry scorning new technology rather than embracing it. 

{artist: Guns N' Roses} frontman {name: Axl Rose} is also making news, though Jim and Greg are wondering why. The buzz is that his long-awaited album {album: Chinese Democracy} is forthcoming -- but our hosts are skeptical. Rose has been saying that he's on the brink of finishing for years (15 to be exact), and in the process he's become one of the long-running [jokes](http://www.spin.com/reviews/guns-n-roses-chinese-democracy-interscope/) in the music industry. But fans can take solace in the fact that the singer recently performed some {album: Chinese Democracy} tracks in {place: New York}. A good sign indeed.

## 00:10:26 Classic Album Dissection: Revolver
![Revolver](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/b3/db/c7/b3dbc75f-4146-3556-ffce-4b679b3aca7e/source/600x600bb.jpg "136975/401136641")

Later this summer {album: Revolver} will celebrate its 40th anniversary. To honor that occasion, our own rock scientists, Drs. DeRogatis and Kot, decided to dissect {artist: The Beatles}' masterpiece. In their interview with {name: Geoff Emerick}, the man who engineered the album at {tag: Abbey Road}, and wrote a [memoir](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592401791/002-9278548-2607266?v=glance&n=283155) on his time with the band, they break down what made the music so revolutionary. A sampling of the fun facts and analysis:

#### Tomorrow Never Knows
The last song on {album: Revolver} was actually the first one written. In December {era: 1965}, after a mind-expanding acid trip, {name: John Lennon} [wrote](http://the-beatles.lyrics-songs.com/lyrics/297/) what would later become "{track: Tomorrow Never Knows}." The completely unique four-track song, with its organ drones, backward guitar, bird calls, and megaphone vocals, perfectly encapsulates what {album: Revolver} was about: {tag: revolution}. Geoff Emerick shares two facts about Lennon's lack of technical prowess. First, not being able to communicate how he wanted his vocals to sound technically, Lennon simply asked Emerick to have his voice sound like monks singing on a mountaintop. Also, the backwards guitar part was a happy accident. Lennon, not knowing how to run a reel-to-reel machine, simply loaded the tape backwards and liked what he heard.

#### Rain
 The interesting thing about this song is that it wasn't even released as part of the original {album: Revolver} album. It was the B-side of a single (paired with "{track: Paperback Writer}") that was recorded during the same session. {label: EMI} expected The Beatles to write and record not only an amazing album, but hit singles as well. Jim recommends fans burn their own complete {album: Revolver} with the addition of these singles.

#### Yellow Submarine
Geoff Emerick's description of recording "{track: Yellow Submarine}" is one of the most entertaining in his book. The session was attended by a raucous group of notable guests including {name: Mick Jagger}, {name: Brian Jones}, {name: Marianne Faithfull} and {name: Patti Harrison}. In the middle of recording, Lennon decided that he wanted to sound like he was singing underwater, and in fact, suggested that he do just that. Out of desperation, the engineer agreed to try it, and placed the microphone in a milk bottle filled with water. In order to protect the microphone he used a condom provided by longtime Beatles roadie {name: Mal Evans}.

#### Eleanor Rigby
Emerick was really innovative in how he recorded different instruments. This is particularly evident on this song, written by {name: Paul McCartney}, which incorporates an eight-piece string section. In fact, none of the Beatles actually played on "{track: Eleanor Rigby}." In order to get the best possible sound, Emerick placed the microphones just inches away from the two violas, two cellos and four violins. Beatles fans are so used to this song that it's hard to imagine what it would be like to experience it for the first time in 1966, let alone on the same record as traditional-sounding rock songs like "{track: Good Day Sunshine}" and "{track: Got to Get You Into My Life}".

#### Taxman
{album: Revolver} marks significant growth in the band's sound, as well as for the individual Beatles. {name: George Harrison} really matured as a songwriter on this album, which has an unprecedented three songs written by him, as opposed to chief songwriters Lennon and McCartney. While Harrison is often thought of as the more transcendental Beatle, Jim notes that "{track: Taxman}" expresses a very normal, earthly concern: paying taxes. While Harrison grew as a songwriter, Emerick admits that he still struggled with the guitar during some of the recording of this album. After wrestling for almost nine hours with the song's famous guitar solo, the part ended up being handed over to {name: Paul McCartney}, who hit it in on the first take.

## 00:40:46 Review: T-Bone Burnett
![The True False Identity](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/9d/56/1f/9d561f5d-7732-e449-f79d-5a57cc4aec2a/source/600x600bb.jpg "2088043/178091776")

Singer/songwriter and {tag: producer} {artist: T-Bone Burnett} recently put out {album: The True False Identity}, his first album in 14 years. Burnett is best known for having produced albums for {artist: Los Lobos}, {artist: Roy Orbison}, {artist: Elvis Costello} and ex-wife {artist: Sam Phillips}. He also produced the hugely successful soundtracks for {tag: *O Brother, Where Art Thou?*}, {tag: *Cold Mountain*}, and {tag: *A Mighty Wind*}. After over a decade-long hiatus, he returned to the studio with drummer {name: Jim Keltner} and guitarist {name: Mark Ribot}. {host: Greg} is glad to have T-Bone back. He loves how the musician uses the studio as an instrument and gives {album: The True False Identity} a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim}, on the other hand, listened to the album and prepared to rumble. He compares the music to that of a similar artist: {artist: Tom Waits}. Jim feels that both men try to be weird simply for the sake of being weird. He wishes that {name: T-Bone Burnett} was as effective a producer for his own work as he is for others', and gives this album a definite {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:14 Review: The Raconteurs
![Broken Boy Soldiers](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/43/41/1a/43411ade-f2a4-f3c2-6b34-27aa451ee06a/source/600x600bb.jpg "129477464/276567248")

The next album up for review is {album: Broken Boy Soldiers} by {artist: The Raconteurs}. The Raconteurs is a side-project for {name: Jack White} of {artist: The White Stripes}. He is joined by power popster (and fellow {place: Michigan} native) {name: Brendan Benson} as well as members of {genre: garage} band {artist: The Greenhornes}. This marks a bit of a departure for White, who favors a much more minimalist approach with the White Stripes, and Greg is not entirely impressed. He feels that too much of the record is merely a {genre: classic rock} [imitation](http://www.ledzeppelin.com/). {host: Greg} suspects that White ceded too much power to Brendan Benson, and wishes that he made more innovative musical choices, as he did on the album he produced for {genre: country} star {artist: Loretta Lynn}. {album: Broken Boy Soldiers} gets a {tag: Burn It} from this critic. {host: Jim}, however, cannot stop listening to {artist: The Raconteurs}, and for him that's all that matters. {genre: Rock and roll} has never been about originality, and according to Jim, every song is catchy and energetic. Jim would {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:55:11 DIJ: Greg
It is Greg's turn to pop a quarter into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, but this week he had a hard time choosing just one song. According to our host, {genre: hip-hop} star {artist: Missy Elliott} is the top singles artist of the last 10 years. Along with producers like {name: Timbaland}, she makes truly {genre: avant-garde} music, but does so in a really fun, accessible way. Therefore, it's no wonder that her songs are critical and commercial hits. For this week's show, Greg went with the song "{track: Work It}." The song demonstrates Missy's novel approach to sounds and words. It isn't really about anything new, but the lyrics, beats and sounds (note the elephant's wail) couldn't sound fresher. In fact, only Missy Elliott could get away with having the hook to a {genre: Top 40} hit be sung backwards. So, you may not be able to [sing along](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/missymisdemeanorelliott/workit.html) to this week's DIJ, but you'll certainly want to.
