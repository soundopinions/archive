## 00:02:12 News: 04.22.06
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} begin the show with a discussion of {tag: Lollapalooza} and other summer {tag: festivals}. There's {tag: Coachella} in {place: California} and {tag: Bonnaroo} in {place: Tennessee}, but {place: Chicago} is shaping up to be the major destination for music fans this year. The Lollapalooza lineup is impressive, with a diverse mix of bands including Lolla vets {artist: The Flaming Lips} and {artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers}, {genre: indie} favorites {artist: Death Cab for Cutie} and {artist: The Shins}, and {place: Chicago} natives {artist: Wilco} and {artist: Kanye West}. Plus, the city will be home to two of the biggest {genre: independent} music festivals: The {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}, featuring {artist: Destroyer}, {artist: Art Brut}, {artist: Spoon} and {genre: post-punk} pioneers {artist: Mission of Burma}, and the {tag: Intonation Music Festival} featuring {artist: The Streets}, {artist: Bloc Party}, {artist: Lupe Fiasco} and a rare appearance by {artist: 13th Floor Elevators} founder {name: Roky Erickson}.

## 00:07:33 Interview: Steve Wynn
In preparation for this week's guest, {name: Steve Wynn}, Jim and Greg do a little primer on the {tag: Paisley Underground} music scene that developed in {place: California} in the {era: 1980s}. {host: Jim} plays a song by one of the seminal bands of this scene, {artist: The 3 O'Clock}, whose very {genre: psychedelic} name was inspired by {name: Tom Wolfe}'s assertion in "{tag: The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test}" that if one drops acid in the early evening, the high of the trip will occur at 3:00 a.m. The 3 O'Clock was helmed by {name: Michael Quercio}, a musician who started as a {genre: punk} rocker. After discovering {genre: psychedelic rock}, however, his sound, and his look, began to change. It was Cuercio's affinity for the music of the {era: '60s}, as well as the brightly colored paisley clothes, that gave this scene its name. While the name did not do the music justice, the influence of the Paisley Underground on contemporary bands like {artist: Oasis} and {artist: The Secret Machines} is undeniable.

It may surprise to listeners who are only familiar with "{track: Walk Like an Egyptian}," but {artist: The Bangles} were also pioneers of the Paisley Underground. Their original sound, with its three- and four-part harmonies and sing-songy melodies, paralleled that of {artist: The Mamas and the Papas} and {artist: The Byrds}. Lead singer {name: Susanna Hoffs} continues to work in this genre; she and {era: '90s} {genre: indie pop} star {name: Matthew Sweet} just released a {era: 1960s} covers album featuring songs by {artist: The Left Banke}, {artist: The Beach Boys} and {artist: The Who}.

Greg points out that the Paisley Underground sound was not a homogenous one -- in fact, what bonded these bands was a {genre: punk} sensibility that welcomed other musical styles. Unlike many other punk bands at the time, these acts didn't see why they had to conform to a strict policy of three-minute, {artist: Ramones}-style songs. And what's more {genre: punk rock} than non-conformity? One band that went above and beyond its punk and psychedelic influences was {artist: The Long Ryders}. They took more of a {genre: country} approach and can be seen as pioneers of the {genre: alternative country} scene that now houses bands like {artist: Uncle Tupelo}, {artist: Son Volt}, and {artist: The Bottle Rockets}.

{artist: The Rain Parade} is the next Paisley Underground band up for discussion. While the members of The Rain Parade never saw the major label success like their peers in The Bangles or The 3 O'Clock (who were signed to {artist: Prince}'s {label: Paisley Park} label), many went on to work on successful projects. {name: David Robeck} formed the band {artist: Mazzy Star}, which had an alternative hit single with "{track: Fade Into You}" in {era: 1993} and {name: Matt Piucci} went on to work with {artist: Crazy Horse}. The remaining bandmates reincarnated themselves as {artist: Viva Saturn}.

{host: Greg} plays a song featuring this week's guest, {name: Steve Wynn}. His band {artist: The Dream Syndicate} was a group that both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} became fans of in the early {era: '80s}. They emerged in {place: LA} as one of the pioneers of the Paisley Underground sound. Steve then released a number of solo records and has spent the last few years with his most recent band, {artist: The Miracle 3}. Steve and his band members, {name: Linda Pitmon}, {name: Dave DeCastro} and {name: Kirk Swan}, joined Jim and Greg for an interview and performance at the {tag: Chicago Recording Company}.

The Dream Syndicate never made it into the {era: 1990s}, but its innovative sound continued to influence artists. While other {place: LA} bands at the time, like {artist: Black Flag}, {artist: Social Distortion} and {artist: Bad Religion}, were making {genre: post-punk} and {genre: punk} music with a really hard edge, The Dream Syndicate stuck to a swirlier, {genre: psychedelic pop} sound. For this reason, Jim and Greg explain, no matter how many solo projects he embarks on, our guest will most likely always be remembered as the lead singer of The Dream Syndicate. 

After playing a track from {album: Days of Wine and Roses}, which Greg calls one of the masterpieces of the Paisley Underground era, our host asks Steve about the chemistry between two guitarists. In this case, Steve's partner in guitar is Kirk Swan, who was in another innovative {era: '80s} {genre: indie pop} band, {artist: Dumptruck}, Steve responds that the basic formula of guitar, drums, and bass is simple, but never gets old. He points to bands like {artist: Neil Young and Crazy Horse} and {artist: Television} as examples.

Jim asks Steve about why he continues on in this business after so many years. As Steve jokes on his website, this new album is one of several "comebacks," but music is not such an easy life to come back to. After being pegged the "new Springsteen," Steve and the band had somewhat of a difficult time. He explains how that hurt the band (and indirectly how he hurt Jim one drunken night). Thankfully they both came out on the other side.

## 00:42:16 Review: The Streets
![The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living (Bonus Tracks)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f7/39/3a/f7393af8-18f9-7581-e936-2ef3edbe74ac/source/600x600bb.jpg "3083671/145546973")
The first album up for review this week is the {album: The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living}, the third album from British rapper {artist: The Streets}. Emcee {name: Mike Skinner} first caught the attention of American fans with his debut album {album: Original Pirate Material} and its hit single "{track: Let's Push Things Forward}." Its follow-up, {album: A Grand Don't Come for Free} achieved a lot of critical and commercial success. In fact, it was one of the top albums of {era: 2004} for Greg. People familiar with these albums will know Skinner's {genre: rap} identity is that of the average bloke -- he typically pairs stories of daily life in {place: England} with chintzy beats. With this album, however, Skinner can hardly think of himself as the everyman. The [narratives](http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/streets_the_lyrics_2477/the_hardest_way_to_make_an_easy_living_lyrics_26833/when_you_wasnt_famous_lyrics_293176.html
) in these songs poke fun at his {genre: pop}-star status and all the pitfalls of fame. While {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} find this new take funny, they don't find it as emotionally poignant. Therefore, it's a {tag: Burn It} from Jim, and a surprising {tag: Trash It} from Greg.

## 00:50:08 Review: Van Hunt
![On the Jungle Floor](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/be/f2/22/bef222a4-a1db-3847-cf1b-ea5b70f6682a/source/600x600bb.jpg "4247226/725280291")
{genre: R&B}/{genre: soul} singer {artist: Van Hunt} also has a new album out. His {era: 2004} self-titled debut album was very well-received -- listeners could hear the funk influences of bands like {artist: Sly Stone} and {artist: Curtis Mayfield}, as well as the more romantic, slow jams of singers like {artist: Marvin Gaye} or {artist: D'Angelo}. (And with a pimp for a father and a nurturing caregiver as a mother, Greg muses, Van Hunt's own family parallels his musical influences'.) On {album: On the Jungle Floor}, Van Hunt stretches himself more. He makes the surprising choice to cover "{track: No Sense of Crime}," a {genre: punk} classic by The Stooges. And, fans will hear the influence of yet another {genre: R&B}/{genre: funk} idol: {artist: Prince}. However, both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} assert that with this release, the grasshopper has surpassed the master, and rate {album: On the Jungle Floor} higher than {artist: Prince}'s new album {album: 3121}. It's a {tag: Buy It} for both critics.

## 00:55:33 DIJ: Jim
It's Mr. DeRogatis' turn to visit the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, and he ties the show up nicely with a selection from the band {artist: Dumptruck}. {name: Steve Wynn} played with one of Dumptruck's founders, {name: Kirk Swan},  during the segment. Swan and his partner, {name: Seth Tiven}, put out their debut album {album: D is for Dumptruck} in {era: 1994}. It was heavily influenced by what {tag: Paisley Underground} bands like The Dream Syndicate had been doing on the West coast. Dumptruck incorporated more {genre: folk rock} and {genre: power pop} into their music than contemporaries, and were also influenced by {artist: Big Star}, {artist: Fairport Convention} (who also count Greg Kot and Sound Opinions [guest](/show/9/) Colin Meloy as fans), and the band {artist: Television}. Like Dumptruck, Television was comprised of two guitarist-vocalists: {name: Tom Verlaine} and {name: Richard Lloyd}. Jim explains that outside of Television, he has never seen two guitarists work as well together as they did in Dumptruck, as you can hear in Jim's DIJ pick, "{track: Alive}." Listeners desiring more Dumptruck should check out {album: Haul of Fame: A Collection}, for which our host provided liner notes.
