## 00:01:52 News: 2.25.2011
Wherever there's {tag: youth culture} and {tag: protest}, there's {genre: rock and roll}. So it's not surprising that {genre: heavy metal} is at the top of many playlists in {place: Bahrain} right now. According to {tag: Evolver.fm}, the mood of that country is "triumphant" and "warlike" if the music's any indication. {tag: Lastmood.fm} uses {tag: Last.fm}'s audioscrobbler to monitor people's listening habits and gauge the vibe in almost real time. The most popular song in one hour was "{track: The Ivory Gate of Dreams}" by {artist: Fates Warning}. But, activists and musicians from the region are also popular. A Bahraini activist, {name: Esra'a Al Shafei}, started {tag: mideastunes.com} which highlights everything from {place: Jordan}ian {genre: punk} to {place: Palestinian} {genre: trance}.

{tag: Fast Company} has named its top ten most {tag: innovative} companies in music, and a the top of the list is {tag: Pandora}. It's remarkable, considering that Pandora was nearly put out of business by royalty debates a couple of years ago. Now it's valued at $55.2 million and has gone public. The {tag: streaming} site has also inked a deal with {tag: GM}. Last year's #1 {tag: Spotify} didn't even make the cut, but it's been reportedly valued at $1 billion -- despite the fact that the digital music service has yet to launch stateside.

## 00:07:25 Interview: Gang of Four
When your musical heroes have their own {tag: musical heroes}, you know it's worth checking out. And one name that always gets checked by everyone from {artist: Franz Ferdinand} to {artist: REM} is {artist: Gang of Four}. The {place: British} band debuted in 1979 with {album: Entertainment!}, an album that showcased {name: Andy Gill}'s unorthodox {tag: guitar} style, {name: Jon King}'s smart lyrics, and a whole lot of danceable groove. The band is still going strong on its latest release {album: Content}, and Jon and Andy sat down with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} while they were on tour.

## 00:44:10 Review: Radiohead
![The King of Limbs - Live from the Basement](http://filtermagazine.com/images/sized/images/uploads/RadioheadDVDjpeg-200x200.jpg "657515/483049207")

 Whenever {artist: Radiohead} releases a new album, it always makes news – sometimes more for the business than the music. 2006's {album: The Eraser} was a quiet solo effort by {artist: Thom Yorke}. 2007's {album: In Rainbows} had a revolutionary "pick-your-own-price" model. And now we have {album: The King of Limbs}, which was released early, quickly and without much hype. Gone is the freebie option, back is tiered pricing. The music, to Greg, is also a bit of a step back. It's less impactful and melodic than *In Rainbows*. But there are a few moments of greatness, especially when the group channels the abstract {genre: funk} that {host: Greg} heard on Yorke's recent {artist: Atoms for Peace} tour. He would like to see Radiohead go more in that direction on the next record and gives this one a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} remarks that the tables have turned – he is much more impressed by *The King of Limbs*. It does take time to grow, but is worth owning, especially if you are a headphone listener. The interaction of Yorke's twisted vocals and the grand piano especially works. Jim says {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:51:32 DIJ: Greg
The {artist: Gang of Four} were heavily {tag: influenced} by {place: Chicago} {genre: blues}, and perhaps no label better represents that sound than {label: Alligator Records}. The label, run by blues fanatic {name: Bruce Iglauer}, is celebrating its {tag: 40th anniversary}. To toast them, {host: Greg} adds one of his favorite tracks by {artist: Hound Dog Taylor} to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. It's the stripped down, raw, mood-setting song "{track: Give Me Back My Wig}."
