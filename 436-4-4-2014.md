## 00:02:15 News: 04.04.14
Pioneering {tag: DJ} and {tag: producer} {name: Frankie Knuckles} passed away this week. Knuckles' musical legacy is arguably as important to {genre: dance} music as {artist: Chuck Berry}'s is to {genre: rock} or {artist: Kraftwerk}'s is to {genre: electronica}. In the early {era: 1980}'s, Knuckles helped cultivate {genre: House} music's sound from the ashes of disco at a venue on {place: Chicago}'s south side called {tag: The Warehouse}. (Hence the name, {genre: House}). The space was an oasis for misfits of all shapes, sizes, and colors to come together and celebrate being alive. As Knuckle's musical stature grew over the years performing at various clubs and remixing other artist's songs, he never lost his generous spirit. In a 2012 [conversation](http://www.wbez.org/story/chicago-sounds-80s-underground-incubator-97196) with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} at the {tag: Museum of Contemporary Art} in {place: Chicago}, Knuckles remarked that he'd never regarded music as a competive sport. "Even though you have people on the dance floor, and people that come out and say this DJ is better than that one, I've never looked at it that way and I've never let that influence me because I'm too busy having a good time and showing people a good time," said Knuckles. He was 59 years old.

## 00:07:51 Interview: Pelican
{genre: Heavy Metal}, {genre: Post-Metal}, {genre: Grindcore}, {genre: Post-Grindcore}...you name it, {artist: Pelican} has been called it. But, however you categorize this hard rocking instrumental group, they bring an awesome noiseâ€”especially live. {name: Trevor de Brauw}, {name: Bryan Herweg}, {name: Larry Herweg} and {name: Dallas Thomas} talk about their desired intensity and play songs from their 2013 album {album: Forever Becoming}, the band's first release since the departure of founder {name: Laurent Schroeder-Lebec}. 

## 00:49:14 Review: The Hold Steady
![Teeth Dreams](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music18/v4/b6/06/73/b6067342-3732-5a0d-743b-c2a3434a26d5/source/600x600bb.jpg "19552743/1127118766")

{place: Minneapolis}-born, {place: Brooklyn}-bred {tag: Beat}-rockers {artist: The Hold Steady} have undergone a few changes since their 2009 [visit](/show/165/) to Sound Opinions. The band took a break after the departure of keyboardist (and [moustache idol](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/img/music2/franznicolay4.jpg)) {name: Franz Nicolay}, while frontman {name: Craig Finn} put out a [solo album](/show/321/). Now the boys are back, with an extra guitarist, {name: Steve Selvidge}, and a sixth album called {album: Teeth Dreams}. It's their first venture with producer {name: Nick Raskulinecz} (best known for his work with {artist: Foo Fighters}, {artist: Rush}, and {artist: Evanesence}), and as Greg points out, their sound is "slicker" than ever. Perhaps too slick -- while the band can still {genre: rock}, the album is bogged down with slow, melodramatic experimentation. {host: Greg} has to say {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} scoffs at the lyricist's {genre: literary} bent -- with Finn so obviously ripping off {name: Raymond Chandler} and {name: Jack Kerouac}, this host has to wonder if it's parody. Regardless, {host: Jim} prefers The Hold Steady live, in their bombastic, {artist: [Bruce] Springsteen}-ian element -- as for {album: Teeth Dreams}, it's a {tag: Trash It}.
