# Show 404: Music of the Civil Rights Movement

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} mark the 50th anniversary of {name: Martin Luther King Jr.}'s "I Have a Dream Speech" with a discussion of the {tag: Music of the Civil Rights Movement}.

![Martin Luther King](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/ihaveadream.jpg)

## 00:01:48 News: 8-23-2013
{artist: Robin Thicke} and his producers {artist: Pharrell Williams} and Clifford Harris Jr.(known to the rest of us as {artist: T.I.})—the team behind this summer's hit single {track: Blurred Lines} —have filed suit against the estate of {artist: Marvin Gaye} and {label: Bridgeport Music}, rights holders to some of {artist: Funkadelic}'s compositions. The reason? Thicke and company claim that no,  "Blurred Lines" sounds nothing like Gaye's {track: Got to Give It Up} or Funkadelic's {track: Sexy Ways}. (Members of the estate of Marvin Gaye, including his son, have [claimed](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/marvin-gaye-son-implies-robin-thicke-ace-lawsuit-article-1.1433640) otherwise).

{artist: Chance the Rapper}'s mixtape {album: Acid Rap} ([reviewed](https://soundcloud.com/soundopinions/sound-opinions-reviews-acid) favorably on our show) has been selling well. The only problem is that Chance isn't the one selling it. Since Chance is lacking in a record deal, he isn't covered by the protection of the RIAA, it's made the selling of his mixtape by a company called "Mtc" (for $14.83 a pop) all the more [complicated](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/5650665/chance-the-rapper-with-acid-rap-mixtape-meets-the). Still, Chance's manager {name: Patrick Corcoran} is looking on the bright side "This shows that there's a strong appetite for Chance in the marketplace," he says. "How often does a bootleg hit a {tag: Billboard} chart?"
