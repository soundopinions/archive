# Show 424: Rodrigo Y Gabriela & Remembering Phil Everly

![Rodrigo y Gabriela](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/rodrigo_web.jpg)

The guitar duo {artist: Rodrigo y Gabriela} record a special acoustic set at the {tag: Goose Island} Barrelhouse. Then {host: Greg} drops the first coin of 2014 into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.

## 00:02:22 News: 01.01.2014 
{name: Phil Everly} died on January 3 at age 74 and as {host: Jim} explains, modern music wouldn't be what it is without {artist: The Everly Brothers} making the connection between {genre: country}, {genre: hillbilly} {genre: folk} and {genre: rock 'n' roll}. It was Phil who hit the high harmony, inspiring countless vocal groups like {artist: The Beatles}, {artist: Simon & Garfunkel} and {artist: The Beach Boys}. And you can hear this timeless, forlorn cry in songs like "{track: When Will I Be Loved}" from 1960. Don't bother with {name: Norah Jones} and {name: Billie Joe Armstrong}'s tribute to the brother duo, which recently received a {tag: Trash It} [rating](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/421/review/billiejoearmstrongnorahjones) from {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. But, do check out efforts by {artist: The Chapin Sisters} and {name: Dawn McCarthy} and {name: Bonny "Prince" Billy}.

## 00:06:24 Interview: Rodrigo y Gabriela
The Mexican duo {artist: Rodrigo y Gabriela} joined us for a special performance at the {place: Goose Island Barrelhouse} in {place: Chicago}. The duo moved from {place: Mexico City} to {place: Dublin} and famously busked on the streets. It's now a worldwide phenomenon, combining the sounds of {genre: flamenco} music, {genre: heavy metal} and {genre: folk rock}. {name: Gabriela [Quintero]} acts as the bands drummer, using the body of her guitar as a percussive instrument, and {name: Rodrigo [Sanchez]} plays the guitar as if he were headbanging. In fact, Greg wonders about his collaboration with {artist: Testament} guitarist {name: Alex Skolnik}. The band's last album, {album: *Area 42*}, took them to {place: Cuba}, where they collaborated with local musicians.

## 00:49:57 DIJ: Greg
Music fans experienced another loss over the holidays: {name: Benjamin Curtis}, one of the founding members of {artist: Secret Machines} died at age 35 after a battle with cancer. He, brother {name: Brandon [Curtis]} and cousin {name: Josh Garza}, visited the show in {era: 2006}, and {host: Greg} fondly remembers their distinctive sound. While contemporaries like {artist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs} and {artist: The Strokes} were steeped in a {place: New York} {genre: punk} and {genre: New Wave} sound, Secret Machines had a more {genre: experimental} and {genre: psychedelic} edge. And when people lament the lack of great modern {genre: rock} bands, Greg refers them to this one. So to remember Ben Curtis and Secret Machines, Greg adds "{track: Nowhere Again}" from the band's {era: 2004} debut {album: *Now Here is Nowhere*} to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
