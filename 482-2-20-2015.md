# Show 482: The Sound Opinions World Tour: Cuba & Opinions on Pops Staples

![Cuba](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/cuba_web.jpg)

Sound Opinions gasses up the byplane and makes its next stop on the {tag: World Tour}: {place: Cuba}. Later they review the posthumous release from gospel icon {artist: Pops Staples}.

## 00:02:19 News: 02.20.15
This week, successful solo singer {artist: Lesley Gore} died from lung cancer at age 68. The "{track: You Don't Own Me}" and "{track: It's My Party}" singer was best known for her work as a teen, singing about heartbreak and female empowerment. But, while the height of her popularlity hit in the {era: 1960's}, later artists like {name: Dusty Springfield}, {name: Joan Jett} and {name: Klaus Nomi} covered her work. Gore also became very active in the {tag: LGBTQ} community and was working on a {tag: Broadway} show and a memoir before her death.

After stops in countries like {place: South Africa}, {place: Japan}, and {place: Sweden}, the **{tag: Sound Opinions World Tour}** is trekking on. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} hop over to {place: Cuba}, inspired by the historic changes in {place: U.S.}-Cuban relations announced recently by {name: President Obama}. Their guide to Cuba's influential rhythms is {name: Ned Sublette}, author of {tag: *Cuba and Its Music: From the First Drums to the Mambo*}. Ned tells us that Cuba has been alive with music ever since the {era: sixteenth century}.  Drawing upon its unique ethnic history, Cuba developed a {tag: polyrhythm}ic style quite different from what emerged in North America. Innovative artists like {artist: Arsenio Rodríguez} brought Cuban dance music into maturity during {era: World War II}. The unshakeable rhythms of the {genre: mambo}, {genre: rumba}, and {genre: cha-cha-chá} filtered into the {place: United States}, particularly in the world of {genre: jazz} – {artist: Dizzy Gillespie}'s collaborations with {artist: Chano Pozo} changed music forever. {genre: Rock 'n' roll} and the {genre: blues} also adopted {tag: Afro-Cuban} flavors. Even after Cuba's isolation following the {era: 1959} revolution, the music never stopped, according to Ned. *{genre: Nueva trova}*, for example, a movement led by singer-songwriters like {artist: Silvio Rodríguez} and {artist: Pablo Milanés}, began to fuse revolutionary politics and idealism with traditional song forms. Cuban rhythms also provided the basis for the global {genre: salsa} phenomenon of the {era: '70s}. Today music in Cuba thrives in both traditional genres and in modern ones like {genre: reggaeton}. Though he's not personally a fan of the hit 1997 {album: Buena Vista Social Club} album, Ned was happy to see {place: North America}ns reengage with Cuban artists. With the political changes underway, he expects to see an even more exciting cultural exchange between Cuban musicians and the rest of the world.

## 00:48:04 Review: Pops Staples
![Don't Lose This](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/7f/52/f1/7f52f132-41d1-8e69-6637-47e7411f010a/source/600x600bb.jpg "527727/951910181")
Reviewing a posthumous release is a tricky thing. You want to honor a great artist with a glowing review, but inevitably there's always something lacking. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree on this when it comes to {artist: Pops Staples}' final album, {album: Don't Lose This}, released 15 years after it the music was recorded and after the artist died. Having Pops on record so late in his life is like a gift to music fans, but Jim hears his voice deteriorating and compares it to {artist: Johnny Cash}'s recordings with {name: Rick Rubin}. Greg agrees that this isn't Pops' best work or the place to start with {artist: The Staples Singers}. But, both critics hear standout songwriting moments that still resonate today. Indeed:  "Don't Lose This."  The album, produced by {name: Jeff Tweedy}, gets a double {tag: Try It}.
