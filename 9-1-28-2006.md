# Show 9: Colin Meloy & Reviews of Cat Power and Test Icicles
This week on Sound Opinions Jim and Greg get a visit from {artist: [The] Decemberists} frontman {name: Colin Meloy}. He talks with them about his solo tour and his love of {artist: Fairport Convention}. Our hosts also review the new album from {artist: Cat Power}, and Greg pops a quarter into the Desert Island Jukebox.

## 00:02:01 List: Pop Stars vs. God
A big news story this week involves the ever-controversial {artist: Kanye West}. The February issue of {tag: Rolling Stone} features West on the cover posing as {tag: Jesus Christ} wearing a crown of thorns. This is not the first time the rapper has been public about his conflicted relationship with [Jesus](http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Kanye-West/Jesus-Walks.html), nor is it the first time a musician has pushed hot buttons with religion. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore this issue and pick the top five instances when a rock star made religious waves.

- {artist: John Lennon} makes the statement: "{artist: The Beatles} are more popular than {tag: Jesus}." While this was more a statement about the absurd level of fame the Beatles had attained, feathers were ruffled nonetheless.
- {artist: Madonna} kisses an African-American {tag: Jesus} figure and includes images of cross burning and the {tag: stigmata} in her video for "{track: Like a Prayer}." As a result, {tag: Pepsi} dropped {artist: Madonna} as a spokesperson. 
- In a misinterpreted move, {artist: Sinéad O'Connor} rips up a picture of the {tag: Pope} on {tag: Saturday Night Live}.
- {artist: XTC} releases "{track: Dear God}," causing a controversy by [aggressively questioning](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/x/xtc/147941.html) the existence of God. 
- {artist: Marilyn Manson} tells a {tag: Spin} reporter, "Hopefully I'll be the person who puts an end to {tag: Christianity}." This comment propelled {name: Tipper Gore}'s organization, the {tag: Parents Music Resource Center}, to start a campaign against the self-proclaimed {tag: Anti-Christ}.

## 00:15:13 News 1.28.2006
In the news this week is the announcement of an end to one of music's biggest beefs, other than those between critics. {place: New York} rapper {artist: Nas} signed with {label: Def Jam Records}, which is now being run by Nas' former rival {artist: Jay-Z}. After years of trading spars over their skills, their love lives, and even their looks in such songs as "{track: The Takeover}" and "{track: Ether}," {artist: Nas} and {artist: Jay-Z} will soon be trading profits. Nas will release four Def Jam albums on his imprint, {label: Jonas Experience}. As rappers like {artist: Ice Cube}, {artist: Eminem} and {artist: 50 Cent} know, however, the tradition of "playing the dozens" in {genre: hip hop} is far from coming to a close.

One of the sources of conflict between {artist: Nas} and {artist: Jay-Z} is that both were trying to fill the shoes of the biggest voice in {place: New York} {genre: hip hop} at the time: {artist: Notorious B.I.G.} Rapper {name: Christopher Wallace} emerged from {place: Brooklyn} to become one of the greatest emcees of all time, proving the validity of the east coast hip hop scene. He is best known for his {era: 1994} hit album {album: Ready to Die}, but also for his role in the escalating war between east coasters and west coasters like {artist: Tupac Shakur} and {artist: Suge Knight}. When Biggie was murdered in 1997, it became clear to the public that this war was having more than just an impact on music. Despite the high profile nature of the case, the {tag: L.A.P.D}. has yet to make any legitimate headway. Because of this, the city was recently ordered to pay 1.1 million dollars to Wallace's family. Big ups to Brooklyn indeed.

## 00:20:17 Interview: Colin Meloy
Next up on the show is an interview with {artist: [The] Decemberists} lead singer {name: Colin Meloy}. Colin came through town on his solo tour and seemed to be enjoying a break from the major label bureaucracy that is now involved in launching a Decemberists tour. 

After performing "{track: Tristan and Isolde}," a song he wrote with his first band, {artist: Tarkio}, Colin discusses his literary roots. While he does put heavy emphasis on narrative in his music, this songwriter hesitates to call himself a storyteller. He cannot hesitate to call himself an author, however -- Colin wrote about {artist: The Replacements}' {album: Let It Be} for the '33 1/3' series, describing the impact that that album made on him as a budding musician.

The next song is "{track: Barbara Allen}," a tune originally performed by {artist: Shirley Collins}, a British {genre: folk} revivalist who has been a big inspiration to Colin. He explains that fans can look forward to hearing more Collins on the next Decemberists record. These same fans can also look forward to Jim's [bodhrán](http://www.hobgoblin.com/bodhran.htm) jam session with the band.

## 00:40:43 Review: Cat Power
![The Greatest](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Cat_Power_The_Greatest.png "2959120/184482392")
Both albums reviewed this week are independent label releases. The first is by {name: Chan Marshall}, better known as {artist: Cat Power}. A much-hyped {genre: indie} darling for some time now, Cat Power just released her fourth full length album, {album: The Greatest}, on the {label: Matador} label. Our critics ponder whether it was appropriately named. According to {host: Jim}--not at all. Frankly, he hates it. He has never been a Cat Power fan, however, and doesn't understand the appeal of Marshall's albums nor her onstage antics. {host: Greg} agrees that {album: The Greatest} is not, in fact, the greatest. But he does not think it's a "{tag: Trash It}" album. He believes it's worth listening to for the fantastic {artist: Memphis Rhythm Band}'s appearance alone. {name: Steve Potts}, {name: Flick Hodges} and {name: Teenie Hodges}, who worked with {artist: Al Green}, provide a wonderful backing for Marshall's sultry voice. The result is a "{tag: Burn It}" for Greg.

## 00:48:01 Review: Test Icicles
![album art](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3e/Test_Icicles_For_screening_purposes_only.JPG)
{album: For Screening Purposes Only} by {artist: Test Icicles} is the next album up for review. This {place: UK} trio joined the {label: Domino} family along with successful acts like {artist: Franz Ferdinand}, {artist: Clinic}, {artist: Sons and Daughters} and the most recent hype, {artist: The Arctic Monkeys}. Many of these acts are considered the "{genre: New Wave} of New Wave" -- yet Test Icicles seem to be [derivative](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jan/27/popandrock) of a slightly later [period](http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/other_stories/documents/04832484.asp). For {host: Greg}, it's too much of a good thing. For {host: Jim}, though, it's too much of everything. {album: For Screening Purposes Only} gets a "{tag: Burn It}" from Greg and a "{tag: Trash It}" from Jim.

## 00:53:51 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} gets to pop a quarter into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} this week, and his choice is {artist: Sandy Denny}'s cover of "{track: I'll Keep it With Mine}" by fellow {genre: folk rock}er {artist: Bob Dylan}. Greg explains that Denny is best known for her appearance on the {tag: Lord of the Rings}-inspired {artist: Led Zeppelin} track "{track: The Battle of Evermore}." That's a shame, according to Greg. In addition to her work British {genre: folk-pop} outfit {artist: Fairport Convention}, Denny composed and performed many great solo songs, including this week's DIJ.
