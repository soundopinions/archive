## 00:01:44 News: 2.24.2012
It all comes back to music, doesn't it? Even the great mystery of {tag: Stonehenge} might have a link to song. According to {place: U.S.} {tag: scientist} {name: Steven Waller}, the {era: Neolithic} builders of the {place: British} stone arrangement were inspired by "auditory illusions." He proposes that when two identical instruments, such as ancient flutes, were played at the same time, the effect was magical and otherworldly. Perhaps, similar to this?

Move over Bill, {name: President Obama} is proving to be the politician with the biggest "X Factor" (sorry Singing Senators). First he {tag: sang} {artist: Al Green} at the {place: Apollo}. Now he's performing with {artist: B.B. King} and {artist: Mick Jagger}-and according to our critics, pretty darn well. So what's next for the executive crooner? Greg votes for some {artist: Eurythmics}, while Jim anticipates the post-office rendition of "{track: My Way}."

## 00:06:43 Interview: Dessa
Try to put {place: Minneapolis}-based performer {artist: Dessa} in a box and you quickly run into problems. She's a philosophy student turned slam poet, a member of {place: Minneapolis}'s {genre: hip hop} collective {artist: Doomtree}, and a lecturer in {genre: hip hop} poetics. In an environment where many rappers and rap fans are quick to dismiss hip hop that mixes {genre: rap} and singing, Dessa's three solo albums combine rap, harmonies, and unusual instrumental backings. She and her band stopped by the studio to [perform](https://vimeo.com/groups/205271) songs from her latest album, {album: Castor, The Twin}. Dessa describes finding inspiration for songs on the city bus, and explains why rap lyrics are not just poetry by another name. She even has some advice for first time performers: If your legs are going to shake, best not to wear shiny pants.

## 00:43:54 Review: Sleigh Bells
![Reign of Terror](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7c/c3/63/7cc363f3-bc99-13da-f6c1-7c091054f4cd/source/600x600bb.jpg "370695831/490170428")

After an acclaimed debut, Treats, {artist: Sleigh Bells} is back with {album: Reign of Terror}. {host: Greg} assumed this two-person noise pop band was just a one record wonder. So he was pleasantly surprised to hear that they've twisted their abrasive, pop-filled sound. There's an unexpected dark, art punk vibe that Greg surmises is due to travails in {tag: guitarist} {name: Derek Miller}'s personal life. So E for Effort...Greg gives Reign of Terror a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim}, on the other hand, never loved Sleigh Bell's noise + melody formula. On Treats, the melodies weren't that melodic and the noise not that original. And he doesn't hear much progression on this second release. So he gives Sleigh Bells a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:50:26 DIJ: Greg
Greg celebrates the 20th anniversary of {album: Meantime} by {artist: Helmet} during his turn at the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. It's an album many people don't consider much anymore, but it's one of his favorites from that era. While we often think about {genre: grunge} and {genre: punk} coming from the {place: West Coast} in the {era: 1990's}, Helmet reflects a sharper, harder-edged {place: East Coast} sound. And like many {era: '80s} and {era: '90s} acts, they too were swept away by big labels. But, with their major debut Meantime, they didn't compromise one iota. So Happy Anniversary Helmet fans! We offer you "{track: Unsung}."
