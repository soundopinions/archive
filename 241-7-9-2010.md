# Show 241: The Rock Fan's Guide to Country & Opinions on The Roots and Scissor Sisters
The {tag: Rock Fan's Guide to Country}: Tune in as {name: Chrissie Dickinson}, {tag: music writer} and former editor of {tag: The Journal of Country Music}, proves why country music deserves our respect. Then {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the new albums from {artist: The Roots} and {artist: The Scissor Sisters}.

![main image](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2010/countrymusic.jpg)


## 00:01:45 News: 7.9.2010 
Hardcore music fans are willing to pay a lot of bucks for VIP tickets and collector's items. But $18 million? That's what {place: Chicago}-based {tag: rare instrument dealer} {tag: Bein & Fushi} is asking for their recent acquisition: a {tag: Vieuxtemps Guarneri}. Made in {place: Italy} in 1741, the Guarneri has been dubbed the Mona Lisa of {tag: violins}, and is adored by violinists like Grammy Award winner {artist: Joshua Bell}. As Geoffrey Fushi explains, $18 million is a fair price when it comes to this prized instrument. In fact, his seller is even being choosy about who gets it. Jim is waiting for this to come back on the market.

## 00:08:53 Special: Country Music
Frequently on the show {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} like to take on a single music genre-often one that needs a little more TLC. And perhaps no genre is more maligned, especially in the rock world, than {genre: Country} Music. We've all joked about the lyrical clich'es-women, booze, death and dogs. And we all know that there's a lot of bad, over-produced arena country dominating today's scene. But, this week's guest thinks country has gotten a bad rap. {name: Chrissie Dickinson} began her career as a punk rocker, but in the {era: 1990}'s she had a country epiphany. Eventually she went on to edit {tag: The Journal of Country Music}. She admits that  "hat acts"  like {artist: Garth Brooks} have not been great for the Nashville sound, but doesn't think that artists should get dismissed merely because they've gone pop. Even {artist: Patsy Cline} was pop-country, or  "countrypolitan."  Chrissie hopes that rock fans will be willing to add mainstream Nashville artists like {artist: Alan Jackson} and {artist: Vince Gill} to their  "country cred"  collection of {artist: Johnny Cash} and {artist: Loretta Lynn}.

## 00:33:42 Review: The Roots
![How I Got Over](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/c0/d7/9b/c0d79be0-7dfc-4bb1-3e20-9bc237694a4f/source/600x600bb.jpg "43680/377445282")
If country music isn't your thing, maybe you're a {genre: hip hop} fan. {artist: The Roots} have released a new album called {album: How I Got Over}. It's the Philly group's first record since becoming the house band for {tag: Late Night With Jimmy Fallon}. The Roots have always had a great reputation as a live act, but Jim thinks that gives short shrift to their terrific recordings. This is a dark album, but also really inspirational, especially towards the end. {host: Jim} gives How I Got Over a Buy It rating. {host: Greg} agrees, adding that {tag: MC} "{name: Black Thought}" and {tag: drummer} "{name: Questlove}" are as strong as ever. The Roots get a double {tag: Buy It.}

## 00:42:19 Review: The Scissor Sisters
![Night Work](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/d4/44/77/d4447722-58e1-df7f-3d3d-ebd89c72971c/source/600x600bb.jpg "5610556/377551223")
{artist: The Scissor Sisters} became a hit with singles like "{track: Comfortably Numb}" and "{track: Take Your Mama}," especially in the U.K. But they haven't been able to translate that success to album sales in the states. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} don't think the 3rd release {album: Night Work} will do much better. They both appreciate the camp pop elements, but hear nothing special and nothing new. Greg is willing to recommend listeners {tag: Burn It}, but Jim says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:30 DIJ: Greg
After talking with Chrissie Dickinson, Greg thought about his own country music epiphany. He got his own guide to the genre from legendary singer {artist: Jimmie Dale Gilmore}, who formed {artist: The Flatlanders} with {artist: Joe Ely} and {artist: Butch Hancock}. As Greg explains, no one in Nashville was buying the credibility of three Texas "Flatlanders," but their unique take on roots country went on to be hugely influential, especially to future alt-country acts. Greg chooses "{track: Dallas}" from the band's one and only release {album: More a Legend Than a Band} to add to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
