# Show 505: 50 Years of The Grateful Dead

![grateful dead](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/dead_web.jpg)

The Grateful Dead has the most devoted following of any rock band in history, but also has its fair share of detractors. Jim and Greg reexamine the legacy of The Grateful Dead as the band celebrates its 50th anniversary.

## 00:01:45 Special: The Grateful Dead
{artist: The Grateful Dead} celebrated its 50th anniversary in July with a series of farewell shows at {place: Soldier Field} in {place: Chicago}. We're using that as an opportunity to reexamine the legacy of the controversial band. The Dead formed in the {place: Bay Area} in the {era: 1960}s and featured a core membership of guitarists {name: Jerry Garcia} and {name: Bob Weir}, keyboardist {name: Ron "Pigpen" McKernan}, bassist {name: Phil Lesh}, drummers {name: Bill Kreutzmann} and {name: Mickey Hart}, with important contributions from lyricist {name: Robert Hunter}. Though it was the prototypical "{genre: jam band}," The Dead's sound was much more eclectic and harder to pin down than that sometimes derisive term indicates, incorporating {genre: free jazz}, {genre: psychedelia}, {genre: bluegrass}, {genre: blues}, early {genre: rock 'n' roll}, and more.

The Dead built a community of devoted fans who would travel with the band from town to town, some of whom would tape the performances and share the recordings, which the band encouraged. Though {tag: Deadheads} contend the true essence of the band was experienced in its experimental live shows, Jim has little patience for the erratic performances and instead prefers the band's early studio recordings. Greg argues that The Dead was a consistently great live band during its peak in the {era: '70}s, before drugs took their toll and the surprise 1987 chart hit "{track: Touch of Grey}" altered the fanbase. Garcia, who died in 1995, was an irreplaceable musical genius, and the band leaves behind a legacy of experimentation, eclecticism, and an unparalleled musical community.

## 00:47:59 Review: Vince Staples
![Summertime '06](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Music7/v4/35/3a/8c/353a8ca3-5809-928b-f6de-e782ba294f8c/UMG_cvrart_00602547373281_01_RGB72_1500x1500_15UMGIM30085.600x600-75.jpg "566639154/1005797955")

The year {era: 2015} has been a prosperous time for {genre: rap} and {genre: hip hop}, with {artist: Fetty Wap}, {artist: Wiz Khalifa}, {artist: A.$.A.P. Rocky}, and {artist: Silento} dominating the charts. However, a new and different kind of artist has emerged with the debut album {album: *Summertime '06*} from {place: California} rapper, {artist: Vince Staples}. An ode to growing up in his native {place: Long Beach}, {host: Greg} finds Staples to be very talented in both writing and articulating his perspective. He compares *Summertime '06* to early works by gangster rappers like {artist: N.W.A.} and likes how he gives a lens into a culture that no one else is really talking about right now. It's a {tag: Buy It} from Greg. {host: Jim} agrees and says that {genre: gangster rap} can easily become {tag: misogynistic} and pro-violence sounding, but that's not really what Staples is interested in doing. Jim compares him to artists like {artist: Kendrick Lamar} and {artist: Chance the Rapper}, but wishes that Vince would write more about the sense of community and positivity in the neighborhoods like Kendrick and Chance do. However, he believes Staples is a very important voice and give *Summertime '06* a {tag: Buy It}.
