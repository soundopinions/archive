## 00:02:20 News: 12.03.2005
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} report on the latest incarnation of {tag: payola}, with Sony BMG and Warner Bros. paying millions on fines for paying off radio stations for airplay. Sony has also been facing several lawsuits for the malicious spyware it encoded onto its CDs. Plus, Jim and Greg look at this year's crop of {tag: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} inductees, including {artist: Black Sabbath}, {artist: Sex Pistols}, and {artist: Blondie}. Finally, they pay tribute to the late great guitarist {artist: Link Wray} and his classic single "{track: Rumble}."

Sound Opinions on Chicago Public Radio begins with Jim and Greg talking with the founding member of the {artist: Velvet Underground}, {name: John Cale}.

## 00:43:47 Review: Madonna
![Confessions on a Dance Floor](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/4e/ad/ef/4eadef7b-ab52-fb19-2123-ad1ce730a0f5/source/600x600bb.jpg "20044/91992239")
The Europeans are devouring {artist: Madonna}'s newest album, {album: Confessions on a Dance Floor}. But {host:Greg}? Not as much. He gives it a {tag:Burn It}, only because it won't cost you anything. {host:Jim} agrees.

## 00:49:42 Review: System of a Down
![Hypnotize - Single](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/0c/41/6f/0c416fed-6179-ad87-4ef4-dc6895918bfc/source/600x600bb.jpg "462715/203801016")
These guys are nuts. {artist: System of a Down}, one of the best {genre: art rock} and {genre: heavy metal} bands in existence, has released two albums in a year. {album: Hypnotize} and {album: Mezmerize} together make one great album. The albums do have some filler, but not enough to prevent {host:Greg} and {host:Jim} to both give the double-album a {tag:Buy It}. 

## 00:55:13 DIJ: Greg
This week, {host: Greg} dropped a quarter in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, and brought the heavy lumber. His choice was {artist: Gloria Jones}'s {track: Tainted Love}." That's right, Gloria Jones, not {artist: Soft Cell}. Soft Cell covered this "{genre: Northern Soul}" classic, and received loads of cash and airplay, but this version is where it all started. Greg also blew Jim's mind by informing him that Gloria was the wife of {name: Marc Bolan}, of {artist: T-Rex} fame. Bolan died in a car crash, and {name: Gloria [Jones]} was the driver in the car.
