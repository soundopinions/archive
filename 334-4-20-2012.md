## 00:01:45 News: 4.20.2012
{name: Dick Clark}, an adult even more youthful than Jim or Greg, died this week at age 82. The "world's oldest teenager" helped put rock and roll on the map through {tag: American Bandstand}. As Greg explains, he was the bridge between the teens and the grown-ups and introduced people to a number of important acts including {artist: James Brown}, {artist: Buddy Holly}, and {artist: Ike and Tina Turner}. While not the hippest of music fans, he also provided a platform for acts like {artist: Public Image Limited} and a young {artist: Madonna}. Though perhaps that was much to his chagrin.

## 00:08:56 Special: Best Second Acts
Go ahead..."call it a comeback." This week Jim and Greg highlight some of rock and roll's best {tag: Second Acts}. These artists either fell into obscurity or went down a bad path before reemerging successfully, perhaps better than before. Famous examples include {artist: Johnny Cash}, {artist: Leonard Cohen} and {artist: Elvis Presley}, who told the world he wasn't yet down for the count at his '{album: 68 Comeback Special}. There's also {artist: Santana}, whose record {album: Supernatural} went 15 times platinum in 1999, decades after his heyday in the late '60s. And don't forget about {artist: Cher}, who at age 53 had the number one song "{track: Believe}." Here are Jim and Greg's favorite "Comeback Kids."

### Jim
- {artist: Paul Weller}
- {artist: Tupac Shakur}
- {artist: Everlast}
- {artist: Mission of Burma}

### Greg
- {artist: Marvin Gaye}
- {artist: Portishead}
- {artist: Roy Orbison}
- {artist: Robyn}

## 00:48:34 Review: Spiritualized
![Sweet Heart Sweet Light](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/79/78/2f/79782fea-5352-4bee-14e9-92394aa4e5e7/source/600x600bb.jpg "459702/1185725844")

{name: Jason Pierce}, the force behind {artist: Spiritualized}, isn't shy about returning to his {tag: inspirations}, album after album. There's the noise/melody combo of the {artist: Velvet Underground}, {place: German} {genre: art rock}, {genre: gospel} music and {genre: free jazz}. But melding those elements together well is no small feat. He does it again on {album: Sweet Heart Sweet Light}, which {host: Greg} says is good, but only 2nd tier. He'd refer listeners back to 1997's {album: Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space}. The new one is just a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} is forced to bite his tongue when he hears this, as he sees Sweet Heart Sweet Light as Spiritualized's most optimistic album to date. Pierce has battled a lot of pain and fought liver disease, and the musical result is a masterpiece. Jim says {tag: Buy It}.
