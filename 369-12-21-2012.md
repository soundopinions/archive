## 00:01:49 Special: Supergroups
This week Jim and Greg ponder the history of the {tag: Supergroup}. This is the {genre: rock} phenomenon where musicians from different bands blend together to form a new group. Take one 1 guitar virtuoso, sprinkle in a legendary drummer and add a dash of star singing-sometimes this is a great success, and sometimes the ingredients just don't mix. Recently there have been a number of new supergroups such as {artist: The Good, the Bad and the Queen}, {artist: Them Crooked Vultures}, {artist: Tinted Windows}, {artist: Dead Weather} and {artist: Monsters of Folk}. For Jim the keys to a winning supergroup are that the members be individually "super," and that they have chemistry together. Greg adds that there needs to be something especially compelling about the super-union for it to be more than just business.
                                                                
Here are some hits and misses throughout history:

- {artist: Traveling Wilburys}
- {artist: Chickenfoot}
- {artist: Million Dollar Quartet}
- {artist: Cream}
- {artist: Blind Faith}
- {artist: Crosby, Stills, Nash} (and Young)
- {artist: UK}
- {artist: Golden Palomino}
- {artist: Electronic}
- {artist: Temple of the Dog}
- {artist: Audioslave}
- {artist: Lucy Pearl}

## 00:49:40 Review: Alicia Keys
![Girl On Fire](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/9a/f2/bd/9af2bd17-5d4f-3bd9-f9ad-0a2092737530/source/600x600bb.jpg "316069/572471967")

Since sweeping the {tag: Grammys} in 2002 with her debut album, {album: Songs in A Minor}, some things have changed for piano pop star {artist: Alicia Keys}. She's married to {tag: producer} {name: Swizz Beatz} and has a young son named Egypt. Alicia might be a "Brand New Me," but on her fifth studio album, {album: Girl on Fire}, she's out to convince us that she's still "red hot." Does she succeed? Unfortunately, {host: Greg} says there's no spark here. While there's no questions Keys has chops, and she's heavily involved in the songwriting, album number five still doesn't let us in on who this {genre: pop} diva really is. He adds that Alicia reminds him of a talented pro-athlete who, when faced with an interviewer, spouts mindless clich'es. {host: Jim} agrees-there's no soul here. Girl on Fire is a piece of pop product circa 2012, and it gets a double {tag: Trash It}.
