## 00:01:45 Interview: Jamila Woods
In the midst of an accomplished career as a poet and educator, {artist: Jamila Woods} launched onto the national music scene with heralded collaborations with {artist: Chance the Rapper}, {artist: Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment}, and {artist: Macklemore}. Last year, she released her debut solo album {album: HEAVN}, which was recently reissued by Jagjaguwar. That record, with its powerful lyrical examinations of black womanhood and police brutality, ended up on both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg's} [Best of 2016](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/576/) lists.

{artist: Jamila Woods} and her band join Jim and Greg in the studio to play songs from the album. She discusses her eclectic blend of {genre: spoken word}, {genre: gospel}, and {genre: hip-hop}, which samples lines from artists ranging from {artist: The Cure} to {artist: Incubus} to {artist: Paula Cole}. She speaks about lessons learned from growing up in the church in {place: Chicago}'s south side and her music's power to speak to people who don't share her experiences.



## 00:39:51 Review: St. Vincent
![MASSEDUCTION](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/18/ec/b2/18ecb2ec-c617-f4bf-cd5c-04d4fc72d04c/source/600x600bb.jpg "198271209/1275220299")
{name: Annie Clark}, aka {artist: St. Vincent}, is back with her 5th studio album {album: MASSEDUCTION}. St. Vincent has carved out a unique presence as an {genre: electronic pop} {genre: singer-songwriter} and teams up with {artist: Taylor Swift} and {artist: Lorde} collaborator and producer {name: Jack Antonoff}. So what do {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think? Jim and Greg disagree hugely on this record. Jim finds the lyrics and melodies to be "schlocky" and too "Broadway." He admits that St. Vincent isn't really his cup of tea and just can't enjoy the record. Jim gives it a {tag: Trash It}. Greg on the other hand, genuinely loves this record. He calls it St. Vincent's most personal record to date for being lyrically and vocally emotional and expressive. Greg doesn't hesitate to give {album: MASSEDUCTION} a {tag: Buy It}.
