# Show 556: Moby & Opinions on The Julie Ruin

![Moby](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/moby_web.jpg)

{artist: Moby} became the face of {genre: techno} with the blockbuster success of his 1999 album {album: Play}. In his new memoir *Porcelain*, he explores his origins in the underground {genre: rave} scene of {era: '80s} {place: New York} up until his mainstream success. Moby joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation. Plus, a review of the new album from post-{genre: Riot Grrrl} band {artist: The Julie Ruin}.

## 00:01:45 Interview: Moby
{artist: Moby} – who [first appeared on the show in 2006](http://soundopinions.org/show/49/) – arrived in {place: New York City} in the {era: late '80s} as a sober Christian {tag: vegan} making his way through the nascent underground {genre: club} scene. A decade later, he was the public face of {genre: techno}, selling 10 million copies of his album {album: Play} and living a life of excess. He's written all about his early career in a new memoir {tag: *Porcelain*}, a book [{host: Jim} compares to {artist: Charles Mingus}'s *{tag: Beneath the Underdog}*](https://www.wbez.org/shows/jim-derogatis/mobys-porcelain-is-a-musical-memoir-that-ranks-with-the-very-best/67afc360-5db1-48ff-ac29-db5813e69e01) as one of the great musical autobiographies.

This week Moby speaks with Jim and {host: Greg} about the gritty but exuberant heyday of {genre: rave} culture and {genre: house} music – and how quickly it all ended. After a string of club hits, Moby confused some critics with the eclectic 1995 album {album: Everything is Wrong}, and alienated just about everybody with the {genre: hardcore punk}-inspired {album: Animal Rights} in 1996. But 1999's {album: Play} was an unprecedented smash, which led, as Moby explains, to the traditional rise-and-fall story arc of fame and decadence.


## 00:43:53 Review: The Julie Ruin
![Hit Reset](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/3d/cd/6d/3dcd6d27-5e6e-086f-8773-ae1e9eff6e99/source/600x600bb.jpg "650113699/1096258786")
As a pioneer of the {genre: Riot Grrrl} movement, {name: Kathleen Hanna} is comfortable making a bold statement with her music. {artist: The Julie Ruin}, the current project from the ex-{artist: Bikini Kill} and {artist: Le Tigre} member, finds her continuing to make a statement, but a much more personal and introspective one. The new album {album: Hit Reset} finds Hanna dealing with issues like illness and abuse. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both have deep respect for Hanna's body of work but are divided on her vocal abilities on this record. For Jim, Hanna's songwriting is top-notch but is undercut by the limits of her singing. He says to {tag: Try It}. Greg isn't bothered by her voice. He finds the variety of musical styles on the album to be ambitious. The {genre: girl group} style harmonies, {genre: new wave} homages, and surprising {genre: ballads} all make it a {tag: Buy It}. 


## 00:50:45 DIJ: Greg
In his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick for this week, {host: Greg} pays tribute to the late {genre: country} legend {artist: Guy Clark}, who died on May 17 at age 74. Although he was never as well known as some of his contemporaries, Greg wants to emphasize Clark's influence as a songwriter and his reputation among {place: Texas} musicians for his generosity and musicianship. He wrote about drifters and rebels and mentored many prominent country musicians. Greg selects the song {track: Desperados Waiting For A Train} from the {era: 1975} album {album: Old Number One} as an example of the kind of sparse, raw songs that Guy Clark was best at writing.
