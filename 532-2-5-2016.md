Later, they review the new album from {genre: Americana} songwriter {artist: Lucinda Williams}.

## 00:02:02 News: 02.05.16
![Jefferson Airplane](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/signe-kantner.jpg)
    In a cosmic coincidence fitting for a {genre: psychedelic rock} song, two founding members of {artist: Jefferson Airplane} died recently on the same day: January 28. {name: Signe Toly Anderson}, the group's original lead singer, died at the age of 74. She sang on the band's 1966 debut album {album: Jefferson Airplane Takes Off} before leaving the group to be replaced by {name: Grace Slick}. Rhythm guitarist and singer {name: Paul Kantner} also died that day. {host: Greg} credits Kantner as being the anchor of the group, harmonizing in between Slick and {name: Marty Balin} and holding the group together instrumentally amid the psychedelic chaos. Kantner also co-wrote some of Jefferson Airplane's most well-known songs like "{track: Wooden Ships}", "{track: Volunteers}", and much of the {album: After Bathing at Baxter's} album. He was a true visionary, exploring utopian ideals and themes of interstellar travel, especially in the underrated early years of {artist: Jefferson Starship}. In honor of his passing, Greg plays Kantner's {name: A.A. Milne} and {artist: Fred Neil} referencing composition "{track: The Ballad of You and Me and Pooneil}."

## 00:49:44 Review: Lucinda Williams
![The Ghosts of Highway 20](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music7/v4/14/80/ef/1480ef84-e300-b22f-faae-00071f408569/source/600x600bb.jpg "267658/1061824040")
Less than two years after releasing a double album, {artist: Lucinda Williams} is back with another one: {album: The Ghosts of Highway 20}. The Louisiana-born singer/songwriter delivers an {genre: Americana} travelogue, using Interstate 20 to document her life growing up in {place: the South}. The highway, which runs from {place: Texas} to {place: South Carolina}, serves as a geographic timeline with which Williams shares her memories, both pleasant and troubling. The ambitious album is comprised of 14 tracks, 11 of which surpass five minutes, and that initially seemed too long for {host: Greg}. Ultimately though, Greg was astounded by this album, especially by the instrumentation executed in large part by the guitar work of {name: Bill Frisell} and {name: Greg Leisz}. The music transports the listener to the {place: South}, where, as Greg puts it, "you can practically feel and see the mist rising up out of the cotton fields." While he would cut a couple tracks from this album, *The Ghosts of Highway 20* is overall a {tag: Buy It} for Greg.

{host: Jim} isn't bothered by the album's length. He loves the psychedelic sound produced by Liesz's pedal steel, as well as Williams' poignant recollection of good times and bad. There are several songs on the album dedicated to death, but her treatment of the subject is neither with dread nor loathing, but with acceptance. Jim was a skeptic of Williams for many years, but her recent work– particularly this album– has made him a believer. It's a {tag: Buy It} for Jim as well.
