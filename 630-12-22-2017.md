# Show 630: Bob Ezrin & Amber Mark 

![Bob Ezrin](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/christmas/bobezrin_web.jpg)

{name: Bob Ezrin}, the "producer's producer," has been behind the boards for many blockbuster epic albums over the years. He shares stories with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about working on classic albums by {artist: Pink Floyd}, {artist: Alice Cooper}, {artist: Kiss}, and {artist: Peter Gabriel}. Plus, up-and-coming {genre: R&B} singer {artist: Amber Mark} shares the song that got her {tag: Hooked on Sonics}, and Greg drops a quarter into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.



## 00:01:01 Interview: Bob Ezrin
Back in 2011, Jim and Greg were joined by super {tag: producer} {name: Bob Ezrin}. When we say super, we're not just referring to his commercial success, but to his sound. Bob Ezrin makes big, epic albums like {album: The Wall}, {album: Destroyer} and collaborated on a staggering 10 records with {genre: metal} god {artist: Alice Cooper}. He also produced {artist:  Lou Reed}'s {album: Berlin} and the self-titled solo debut from {artist: Peter Gabriel}. He talked with Jim and Greg about reuniting with Cooper for {album: Welcome 2 My Nightmare} and shared studio tidbits. Now we know what a prankster {name: Roger Waters} was and how Ezrin captured the crying sounds in "{track: Oh Jim}." And who knew Peter Gabriel had such a good sense of humor? 
This interview was one of our favorites so we thought we'd share it again.  


## 00:43:16 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Amber Mark
![Amber Mark](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2017/amber_mark.jpg)
{artist: Amber Mark} is a young, up-and-coming singer whose sound is a mixture of {genre: R&B}, {genre: soul} and {genre: pop}. Mark recently made a splash with her EP {album: 3:33am}, a record about the sudden passing of her mother. Critics lauded her strong voice and evocative lyrics, and she's currently signed to the British independent label {label: PMR} with distribution through the famous {label: Interscope Records}. Amber Mark shares that the artist that got her "{tag: Hooked on Sonics}" is {artist: Michael Jackson}, and the song that made her love music was the percussive "{track: Working Day and Night}" from his {album: Off the Wall} album. Listen to Amber tell the story of first hearing the song and the unique experience of sitting in the V.I.P. section at Michael's concert in {place: Munich}.


## 00:48:09 DIJ: Greg
{era: 2017} has been a challenging year for many people, and {host:  Greg}'s pick for the {tag: desert island jukebox} gave him some solace from the recent turbulence. Inspired by a cover he saw performed by {artist: Ted Leo}, Greg chose "{track: It's O.K.}" by the {place: Portland} {genre: punk} band {artist: Dead Moon}. Led by a husband and wife duo, Dead Moon was extremely DIY - doing almost all of their own recording and surrounding duties. Recently, Fred Cole (the husband in the duo) passed away. Greg wanted to play this song as a tribute to him, and to encourage others that even though "we've all seen better daysâ€¦it's okay, yeah we love you anyway."
