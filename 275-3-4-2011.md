## 00:01:53 News: 3.4.2011
{genre: Pop} music invaded the {tag: Academy Awards} last week. Veteran {tag: singer}/{tag: songwriter} {artist: Randy Newman} {tag: won} the {tag: Oscar} for {tag: Best Original Song}. It was Newman's {tag: twentieth nomination}, but only second win. Despite that, it is revenue from soundtracks like {tag: *Toy Story*} that have enabled him to be so prolific. You can't count on the music industry alone, which Newman compared to a "bank that's already been robbed." Another rocker, {artist: Trent Reznor}, went home with the {tag: Best Original Score} prize for {tag: *The Social Network*}. That category is usually dominated by {tag: composers} like {artist: James Horner} and {artist: Hans Zimmer}. Zimmer, for one, was hopeful that Reznor's win would open doors for more non-traditional musicians in film.

If you've never heard of {artist: The Seeds}, chances are you've heard their tunes. The {genre: garage rock} band's music has been featured in a number of movies and commercials and covered by tons of artists. But according to lead singer {name: Sky Saxon}'s {tag: estate}, {tag: no royalties} have been coming in. Saxon died in 2009, and now his estate is {tag: suing} his {tag: former label} and {tag: music publisher} for royalties.

## 00:06:52 Interview: Jac Holzman
![Jac Holzman](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2011/JacHolzmanPic.jpg)

Before there was a {label: Merge} or a {label: Matador} there was {label: Elektra Records}. The great {place: American} label recently celebrated its {tag: sixtieth anniversary}, and its {tag: founder} {name: Jac Holzman} is being {tag: inducted} into the {place: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} later this month. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to Jac about launching Elektra as an independent {genre: folk} label out of his dorm room in 1950. Eventually the roster grew to include every genre of music – {genre: blues}, {genre: rock}, {genre: funk}, {genre: world} and {genre: pop}. It became the home to {artist: The Stooges}, the {artist: MC5}, {artist: Love} and {artist: Queen}, and, Jim adds, some notoriously difficult personalities. But Jac insists no artist was too hard to handle. He did use caution when out drinking with {artist: Jim Morrison}, however.

## 00:41:05 Review: Adele
![21](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/cf/7e/47/cf7e47a8-bb18-9156-43d0-7591d0e0855e/source/600x600bb.jpg "262836961/420075073")
This week {place: British} singer {artist: Adele} bumps the big names off the {tag: Billboard} chart. Her new album {album: 21} is currently at {tag: #1}. The former hairdresser impressed Jim and Greg with her debut {album: 19}, and now she's amped up the production with some big names including {artist: Beyoncé}, {name: Rick Rubin} and {name: Dan Wilson}. But bigger isn't always better. {host: Greg} loves Adele's powerful voice, but the quality of the singing trumps the quality of the songs. He gives {album: 21} a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} is even more disappointed. He thinks Adele should know better than to sing some of the "nonsense" on this record. She's gone Hollywood, so he's going with a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:47:44 Review: Lucinda Williams
![Blessed (Deluxe Edition)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/ff/68/3b/ff683b58-08dc-1c32-0362-08e54c1e0ccc/source/600x600bb.jpg "267658/420984064")
{tag: Singer}/{tag: songwriter} {artist: Lucinda Williams} also has a new album out called {album: Blessed}. Now that she is happily married she's moved on from woeful bar tales to songs about other people. {host: Jim} loves this approach, especially on songs like "{track: Soldier's Song}" that are from the point of view of a G.I. {host: Greg} agrees – Williams has reinvented herself. This goes for the singing as well, and he credits {tag: producer} {name: Don Was} for pulling everything back to make way for that voice. Williams is doubly *Blessed* with two {tag: Buy It}s.
