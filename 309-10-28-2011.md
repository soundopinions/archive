## 00:49:24 Review: Tom Waits
![Bad As Me (Deluxe Version)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/bb/a8/a2/bba8a20c-7431-0d7c-48e4-922c65b8b889/source/600x600bb.jpg "83964/458227332")

Whenever we solicit nominations for Halloween songs, one name comes up time and time again: {artist: Tom Waits}. The boozy saloon crooner has a creepy voice, and dark, edgy narratives to match. His latest is called {album: Bad As Me}, and yes, {host: Jim} says, that about sums it up. He hasn't been a fan of Waits since his {album: Swordfishtrombones} days, calling the singer/songwriter shticky and grating. This album is no different, and he says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} is a little surprised, considering this is Waits' most accessible, hook-laden effort in years. What Jim calls shtick, he calls theatricality. And he admits that sometimes the theatricality obscures the plain good songwriting, rooted in old blues. Greg especially likes the collaboration with {tag: keyboardist} {name: Augie Myers}. He says {album: Bad As Me} is a {tag: Buy It}.
