## 00:01:53 News: 4.29.2011
Jim calls {name: Poly Styrene} one of the most important female rock figures from the {era: 1970's} - right up there with {artist: Patti Smith}. And this week, she {tag: died} at age {tag: 53}. {name: Marianne Elliot-Said} adopted the persona of Poly Styrene after seeing the {artist: Sex Pistols} play in {place: London}. She went on to front her own band {artist: X-Ray Spex}. They only put out one album, {album: Germ Free Adolescents} in 1978, but it's a classic. To say farewell to Poly, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} play a track from that record called "{track: I Live Off You}."

## 00:07:35 Special: Bob Dylan
![alkooper](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2011/alkooper.jpg)
Today is {tag: Part 2} of our appreciation of {artist: Bob Dylan}. During this episode, Dylan plugs in. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss how and why Dylan went electric in {tag: 1965}, and get a first-hand account of his famous, or infamous, {tag: concert} at the {place: Newport Folk Festival} from {tag: musician}, {tag: songwriter} and {tag: A&R} man {name: Al Kooper}. Al performed with Dylan onstage at Newport, and he explains to Jim and Greg that there has been a lot of misinformation when it comes to the "boos." He also lent his signature {tag: organ} playing to tracks like "{track: Like a Rolling Stone}," which really changed the game in {genre: rock 'n' roll}. 

In the second half of Jim and Greg's discussion with Al Kooper, they focus on the masterful double album {album: Blonde on Blonde}, which turns 45 this year. Al shares memories from the recording sessions in {place: Nashville} where he, Dylan and {name: Robbie Robertson} were joined by {tag: harmonica} player, {tag: guitarist} and {tag: bassist} {name: Charlie McCoy}, guitarist {name: Wayne Moss}, guitarist and bassist {name: Joe South}, and {tag: drummer} {name: Kenny Buttrey}. Al recalls being truly impressed with the musicians, and describes the vibe as much more refined than during the chaotic sessions of {album: Highway 61 Revisited}. He compares {album: Blonde on Blonde} to a finely manicured lawn. To go out, Jim and Greg play their two favorite tracks from the album. Jim goes with "{track: Leopard Skin Pill-box Hat}," which illustrates Dylan's sense of music history and also his great use of humor. Greg plays "{track: Visions of Johanna}" which he describes as the quintessential song from the quintessential Dylan album.
