# Show 18: SXSW 2006
This week Jim and Greg bring Austin to Chicago. The rock critics have returned from the {tag: SXSW} Music Festival to tell you about some of the best new music you'll be hearing about in the year to come.

![SXSW](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2006/sxsw06.jpg)

## 00:01:25 Feature: SXSW '06
This week on the show, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share their recent experiences at the {tag: SXSW} Festival in {place: Austin}, {place: Texas}. Our hosts joined over 10,000 other festival registrants to attend music industry panels, conduct interviews, and most importantly, see new bands. In the four days they were there, Jim and Greg heard a lot of music. They share some of the best with you. 

- First is {artist: The Dresden Dolls}. {host: Jim} went to see the {place: Boston} group and fell in love with their blend of German {genre: cabaret} performance style and {era: '80s} {genre: synth-pop} melodies. You can hear a little bit of "{track: Modern Moonlight}" off their upcoming release, {album: Yes Virginia}.

- Next up, {host: Greg} discusses one his finds: {artist: Art Brut}. He enjoyed this British band's straightforward melodies, catchy choruses, and witty monologues so much that he saw them twice in Austin. This critic even scrawled "New Kings of Rock" in his notebook following one performance. Jim joined him to see the band at the {tag: Pitchfork [Music Festival]}/Windish party, where they shared a bill with {artist: RJD2}, {artist: Spank Rock}, and one of {host: Greg}'s other discoveries, Swedish {genre: indie pop} quintet {artist: Love is All}. Art Brut, who just recently played a sold-out show at the Metro, entertained the entire staff so much that they were invited to appear on the show the week after the festival wrapped. Listen for that interview in the weeks to come.

- In between running from show to show, Jim and Greg took a brief moment to sit down with {artist: The Beastie Boys}. The {genre: hip-hop} pioneers were down in Austin to promote their recent concert film, {tag: *Awesome; I Fucking Shot That*}, and spoke to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about making the movie, {tag: sampling}, copyright laws, and the longevity of their career.

- Back to the rundown of our hosts' favorite Austin discoveries. Jim's next pick, {artist: The Black Angels}, actually hails from the {place: Texas} state capital. After reading [Jim's book](http://www.jimdero.com/TurnOn/TurnOnOpen.htm) on {genre: psychedelic rock}, members of the band contacted him and explained that they were right up his alley. They were right. {host: Jim}, who caught some of the dark, {artist: Velvet Underground}-influenced music in the sterile environment of Austin Convention Center, was totally blown away. To describe the band, he quotes their website which begs the listener to "Picture a red moonlit night, deep in the heart of Texas, with the ghosts of {artist: Nico} and {name: Timothy Leary} being called back from the dead to guide you on a journey through Heaven & Hell and back again." Whoa, man...

- {host: Greg} loves coming to Austin to see bands that may not get to the States otherwise. One such band is {artist: Serena Maneesh}. The Norwegian group is one of many contemporary bands compared to {artist: My Bloody Valentine}. Often referred to as "shoegazers," these musicians are often literally standing, staring at their shoes, while producing a heavy, overdriven, almost {genre: symphonic} guitar sound. Serena Maneesh is certainly channeling this influence -- however, as Greg explains, this band is also quite performative. Our host describes how the lead guitar player, theatrically dressed as a gypsy showman, was joined by an "Amazonian" bass player. Only during {tag: SXSW} can you see this in Texas, notes Jim.

![Tim Fite at SXSW 2006](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2006/fitesxsw.JPG)

- We next hear some audio of {tag: Jim} recorded down in Austin. He is describing one of his favorite acts: {artist: Tim Fite}. Some may remember Fite's previous incarnation in {artist: Little T and One Track Mic} and their one [hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtcb4E0Ado0&feature=kp), "{track: Shaniqua}." But after getting signed to {label: Atlantic} and touring with {artist: Outkast}, Little T went nowhere. Now, Fite has reinvented himself as a {era: 1920s} southern preacher/rapper who combines an {tag: *O Brother, Where Art Thou?*} sound with irreverent lyrics and {genre: hip-hop}. {album: Gone Ain't Gone} is forthcoming on {label: Anti-/Epitaph}, making Fite label mates with {artist: Neko Case} and {artist: Blackalicious}.

- The Swedish band {artist: Love is All} (mentioned above) is another of {host: Greg}'s discoveries. This Swedish {genre: indie-pop} group is one of many European bands who are rediscovering American music. This band is particularly influenced by musicians like {artist: James Chance and the Contortions} and {artist: Lydia Lunch} who fused both {genre: jazz} and {genre: punk}. {album: Love is All} became Greg's go-to CD while he was driving around the city of {place: Austin}. 

- Listeners can now hear what {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} really sound like at {tag: SXSW}: definitely over-tired, and perhaps over-served. Our hosts caught up with Sound Opinions H.Q. immediately after going to see {artist: Rhys Chatham} at Austin's Central Presbyterian Church, an experience they described as slightly mind-blowing. The {genre: avant-garde} guitarist has basically been living in exile in {place: Paris} for the past decade, but emerged in Austin with a newly-formed guitar army: eight guitarists including {name: Doug McCombs} of {artist: Eleventh Dream Day} and {artist: Tortoise}, {name: Ernie Brooks} of {artist: The Modern Lovers} and {name: Thurston Moore} of {artist: Sonic Youth}. Jim reports that Chatham recently received a grant allowing him to realize his long-fantasized 100-member guitar ensemble.

- One of the {tag: SXSW} events {host: Greg} always tries to attend is {artist: Alejandro Escovedo}'s Sunday night show. This year {artist: Grady} was one of the opening acts. Greg found their huge, overpowering sound on par with that of Chatham's guitar army. He also compares their sound to that of {artist: ZZ Top}'s early days. Listen for yourself as Greg plays a sample of their 2004 release {album: Y.U. So Shady?}

- {artist: White Whale} is {host: Jim}'s final discovery. He caught the band at the {label: Merge} showcase, a label that usually delivers for this critic. He was again not disappointed. White Whale, whose members have been in a number of other {genre: indie rock} bands including {artist: Butterglory}, {artist: Three Higher Burning Fire} and {artist: The Get Up Kids}, impressed Jim with more than just its name. He found their sound to be a mix of {artist: Nick Drake} and {artist: Pink Floyd}, and also reminiscent of {label: Elephant Six} bands like {artist: Apples in Stereo} and {artist: Neutral Milk Hotel}. So far their music can only be heard on {tag: Myspace}.com, but White Whale may turn out to be another SXSW success story.

- {host: Greg}'s final pick is a band called {artist: Katahdin's Edge}. He caught the group after originally trying to see a Finnish band who couldn't make it into the country. He was blown away, and despite getting thousands of free CDs for his day job, Greg was compelled to put down his own money for a Katahdin's Edge album. This trio from {place: Providence} is an example of how {genre: jazz} and {genre: rock} can [fuse](http://www.mmw.net/) in a great way. Rather than take an academic approach to jazz, Katahdin's Edge had a {genre: rock and roll}, party edge that Greg really appreciated.

- {host: Greg} was also caught on tape before and after seeing the biggest hype of this year's festival: {artist: The Arctic Monkeys}. This has been quite the year for the young British band. In January they broke records for first-week sales in the {place: U.K.} with their debut release {album: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not}. In addition, they've been proclaimed by many in the press as the greatest band to emerge from the U.K. in years. That's a lot for a new band to live up to, but Greg was pleased with what he saw. While the Arctic Monkeys may not be what their hype claims, the music was well-rehearsed, packed with rhythm, and downright "ferocious" according to our host. Plus, the lead singer already seems to have the rock and roll attitude down.
