# Show 169: Frightened Rabbit & Opinions on A.R. Rahman and Morrissey
Scottish rock band {artist: Frightened Rabbit} stop by during their tour through {place: North America}. Tune in to hear their conversation with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, as well as performances from their heartbreak-inspired album {album: The Midnight Organ Fight}. Plus, reviews of {artist: A.R. Rahman}'s soundtrack to {tag: Slumdog Millionaire} and {artist: Morrissey}'s latest album.

## 00:04:43 News: 02.20.09
The first news item this week is a sad one for {host: Jim}, {host: Greg} and all indie music fans in and outside of {place: Chicago}. Long-time label {label: Touch and Go Records} has announced that it is shrinking its business and cutting ties with more than 20 other indie labels. Label founder {name: Corey Rusk} made a statement explaining that Touch and Go can no longer afford to provide manufacturing and distribution services to such labels as {label: Drag City}, {label: Flameshovel} and {label: Kill Rock Stars}. This announcement is especially disheartening since it comes on the heels of the label's 25th anniversary.

Anyone who discounted {artist: Madonna} after she turned 50 will be surprised to hear that she is as relevant as ever -- at least commercially. According to Billboard, the {genre: pop} star is the top-earning artist of 2008 with over $240 million. As Jim and Greg explain, this is not just good news for Madonna, but for her 360 promoters {tag: Live Nation}. Distantly trailing the Material Girl are {artist: Bon Jovi}, {artist: Bruce Springsteen}, {artist: The Police} and {artist: Celine Dion} -- not a youngin' in the bunch.

## 00:09:29 Interview: Frightened Rabbit
When some people go through a break-up, they turn to their family, friends or a pint of ice cream. But {name: Scott Hutchison} of {artist: Frightened Rabbit} turned to songwriting. In fact, the Scottish quartet's new album {album: Midnight Organ Fight}, was almost entirely inspired by the devastating end to a relationship. As he and bandmate/brother {name: Grant Hutchison} explain to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} -- the music ended up being cathartic, not just for them, but for audiences as well. Scott, the group's singer and guitarist, has moved on to a new relationship, but the heartbreak lives on in songs like "{track: Poke}" and "{track: The Modern Leper}, which you can hear performed live in our studio. Hear all the songs here.

## 00:37:36 Review: A.R. Rahman
![Slumdog Millionaire (Music From the Motion Picture)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/fd/d1/3e/fdd13e60-6588-39db-b94d-d92749bf75fb/source/600x600bb.jpg "36270/696403730")
The Oscars air this Sunday, and one the nominees up for a number of awards is {artist: A.R. Rahman}, the man behind the soundtrack to {tag: Slumdog Millionaire}. Rahman is a giant in the {tag: Bollywood} world, and now many people are comparing him to mainstream giants like {name: Bernard Herrmann} and {name: Andrew Lloyd Webber}. {host: Jim} wouldn't go that far. He thinks there are a number of intoxicating tracks that incorporate sitar, {genre: African} drumming and {genre: techno}. But he doesn't find the soundtrack to be a beginning-to-end success. Jim gives the {album: Slumdog Millionaire} {genre: soundtrack} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} agrees that some of the songs are too melodramatic, but because of the tremendous rhythms, he thinks they work. He recommends the album as a perfect introduction to Rahman's music and gives the Oscar-nominated soundtrack a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:44:30 Review: Morrissey
![Years of Refusal](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/fb/a3/4c/fba34cd5-13c4-ee80-03e4-f1500d0ab078/source/600x600bb.jpg "383968/302740341")
{artist: Morrissey} is back with a new album, {album: Years of Refusal}, and an old attitude. The songs on his last release {album: Ringleader of the Tormentors} showed a softer, happier side of the Irish {genre: rock}er. But, as his fans know, {tag: Moz} is best when he is miserable. Greg compares his newfound mid-life aggression to that of {name: Nick Cave}. The quips aren't as witty as some of {name: Morrissey}'s best, but the music is as good as ever. {host: Greg} gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} agrees. This is some of the best work Morrissey has ever done. He also gives a Buy It rating.

## 00:50:23 DIJ: Greg
{artist: Fleetwood Mac} has reunited for another tour, inspiring Greg's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick this week. While most people think of {name: Lindsay Buckingham} or {name: Stevie Nicks}, Greg's favorite incarnation of Fleetwood Mac was the earliest, with British {genre: blues} guitarist {name: Peter Green}. An idol to peers like {artist: Eric Clapton}, {name: [Peter] Green} heavily influenced {genre: heavy metal} musicians. But, he was also hit hard by {tag: LSD} use. According to Greg, you can hear Green's descent into madness, as well as his guitar skills, in this week's DIJ song, Fleetwood Mac's "{track: Green Manalishi}."
